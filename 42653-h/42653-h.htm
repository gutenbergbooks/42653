<h1>FULL-BACK FOSTER</h1>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>MYRON ARRIVES</small></h2>


<p>His name was Myron Warrenton Foster, and he
came from Port Foster, Delaware. In age he was
seventeen, but he looked more. He was large for
his years, but, since he was well proportioned, the
fact was not immediately apparent. What did
strike you at once were good looks, good health
and an air of well-being. The pleasing impression
made by the boy’s features was, however,
somewhat marred by an expression of self-satisfaction,
and it may be that the straight, well-knit
figure carried itself with an air of surety that was
almost complacent. So, at least, thought one who
witnessed Myron’s descent from the New York
train that September afternoon.</p>

<p>“There’s a promising-looking chap,” said Jud
Mellen, “but he somehow gives you the impression
that he’s bought Warne and has come down
to look the town over.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry Cater laughed as he picked his trunk
check from a handful of coins. “Lots of ’em look
that way when they first arrive, Jud. I’m not
sure you didn’t yourself,” he added slyly.</p>

<p>“If I did, I soon got over it.” The football
captain smiled drily, his gaze following the subject
of their remarks. “Just as I suspected,” he
continued. “It’s a taxi for his. Four blocks is
too far for the poor frail lad.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, Jud, be fair. Maybe he doesn’t
know whether the school’s four blocks or forty.
Besides, he’s much too beautifully got up to tramp
it. He might get dust on that corking suit of his.”</p>

<p>“It is rather a good-looking outfit, and that’s
a fact. Maybe if I was dolled up like that I’d
want to ride, too. Well, come on, Katie, and let’s
get up there. Practice is at three, and you’ve got
only about forty minutes to find yourself in.”</p>

<p>Harry Cater, or “Katie,” as he was known at
Parkinson School, had been more charitable than
correct in assuming that the new boy was uncertain
of the distance between station and school,
for the catalogue had definitely said four blocks.
But had the distance been two short blocks instead
of four long ones it is unlikely that Myron
Foster would have walked. Not that he had anything
against walking; he recognised it as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
healthful and beneficial form of exercise, as well
as a pleasant occupation under some circumstances;
but he was used to patronising automobiles
when it was necessary to get from one
place to another. At home there were two cars
usually at his service, and when he was away
from home a taxi-cab served as well. He couldn’t
remember when walking had been a necessity,
for prior to the autos there had been carriages,
and before the carriages&mdash;which had included a
pony-cart for his especial use&mdash;there had been an
English perambulator with easy springs and
shining varnished leather top; and beyond that
his memory didn’t go.</p>

<p>The vehicle that Myron found himself in
brought a smile of amused disdain to his face. It
was cheap and small and none too clean, and it
made more noise as it whisked over the cobbles
than a boiler works. However, when it crossed
Adams Street and reached the asphalt it quieted
down considerably and its occupant was able to
obtain a rather more distinct impression of the
little town that was to have the honour of being
his place of residence for the ensuing nine months.
He rather liked what he could see of it, especially
when, having bumped across the trolley tracks
on Main Street, he found himself in what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
evidently the residential part of Warne. The
shops had given way to neat, sometimes rather
showy, dwellings on his right, set behind picket
fences or lilac hedges, the latter looking sere and
frowsy after a hot summer. On his left was a
quaint, century-old burying ground in which mossy
slate slabs leaned precariously under the cool,
deep shadows of giant elms and maples. The
church beyond, with its unlovely square steeple,
peered through the trees in friendly fashion at
the newcomer. At the next intersection the boy
caught a glimpse of the inscription “Washington
Ave.” on a signboard, and in the next moment had
his first view of the school. To his left the campus
stretched for two long blocks, a level oblong of
green turf intersected by gravel paths and shaded
by linden trees. Beyond the campus the school
buildings ran in a straight line, or, to be exact,
five of them did; there were several others out of
position, so to speak, among them that to which
he was being whisked. From Maple Street the
taxi bounded on two wheels around a corner into
a gravelled avenue, past the little brick Administration
Building, turned again by the gymnasium
and a moment later brought up with a squeaking
of brakes in front of Sohmer Hall.</p>

<p>Sohmer was the most recent addition to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
dormitories, and the most luxurious. Although
it followed the architectural style of the others
and, at first glance, looked quite as old and quite
as New England, it nevertheless possessed modifications
that stood for a convenience and comfort
that the other dormitories lacked. The driver of
the taxi, a sandy-haired, gum-chewing young man
with the cheap air of a village “sport,” looked
disdain as Myron pointed to the brown leather kit-bag
and remarked carelessly: “You might just
fetch that along.”</p>

<p>“Sure!” jeered the driver, pushing back a battered
straw imitation of a Panama hat from his
heated brow and grinning widely. “And maybe
you’d like me to unpack it for you, kid, and hang
up your things? I ain’t got nothing else to do,
and a quarter’s a lot of money, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I haven’t asked you what I owed yet, have
I?” said Myron. “If carrying that bag is worth
another quarter why not carry it and get the
money? I dare say I can scrape up a half somehow!”</p>

<p>“Oh, whyn’t you say so?” muttered the other.
“How’d I know you was John D. Vanderbilt?
Where’s it going?”</p>

<p>“Number 17, wherever that is. Second floor,
I think.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“Most of you guys,” continued the driver affably
as he led the way up the slate stairway,
“expects us to lug trunks and everything and
don’t want to slip us anything extra. Nothing
doing! I’m willing to be obliging, see, but I ain’t
in business for my health, mister. Here you are,
sir. Number 17, you said? Door’s unlocked.
Gee, some room, ain’t it? What about your trunk,
sir? Want me to fetch it for you?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s coming by express. That’s all, thanks.
Here you are. There’s a quarter for the ride, a
quarter for the bag and a quarter for a tip. All
right?”</p>

<p>“Sure! You’re a real gentleman, mister. Say,
any time you want a taxi or&mdash;or anything, see, you
send for me. Name’s Eddie Moses. Telephone
to Benton’s cigar store and they’ll give me the
call.”</p>

<p>“All right, Eddie. All doors open out.”</p>

<p>“That so? Oh, all right. You can be sassy
with me any time you like for a quarter!” And
Mr. Eddie Moses, chuckling at his wit, took himself
away, leaving Myron at leisure to look around
his quarters.</p>

<p>Number 17 Sohmer consisted of two rooms, a
good-sized square study and a sleeping room off
it. The study windows&mdash;there were two of them&mdash;overlooked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the campus, although this afternoon,
since the lindens still held their leaves, the
view was restricted to so much of the campus as
lay between the hall and the path that stretched
from the gymnasium to the main gate on Washington
Avenue. The bedroom also had a window
with a similar outlook. This apartment was only
large enough to hold the two single beds, the two
chiffoniers and the two straight-backed chairs constituting
its furnishing, and Myron soon turned
back from the doorway and removed his gaze to
the study again. There were, he decided, possibilities
in the study. Of course he would get rid
of the present junk, but it must serve until his
furniture came from home, which ought to be in
another three or four days. It had been his
mother’s idea to ship the things from his grey
and yellow room at Warrenton Hall. She thought
Myron would be less homesick if surrounded by
the familiar objects of home. Myron’s own idea
had been to purchase a new outfit in Philadelphia,
but when he had seen how set his mother had been
on her plan he had not insisted. The only thing
that troubled him now was that, recalling the
number and generous proportions of the articles
on the way, he feared the study would be far too
small to hold them! Why, his couch alone would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
take up almost all of the end of the room where
the windows were! Well, he would just have to
use what he could and store the other things somewhere:
or send them home again.</p>

<p>He had tossed his hat on the stained table that
occupied the centre of the study&mdash;in shape that
hat was not unlike the one worn by Eddie Moses,
but all similarity ended right there&mdash;and now he
removed his jacket of steel-grey, serge-like material,
rolled up the sleeves of a pale yellow silk
shirt and passed into the bedroom to wash. It may
be well to state in passing that Myron affected grey
and yellow, both in his room furnishings and in
his attire. It was a conceit of Mrs. Foster’s. She
was fond of colour combinations and, could she
have had her way, would have prescribed for
every member of her household. But Myron was
the only one who consented to be guided by her
taste. He didn’t care a rap whether his wallpaper
was grey with yellow stripes or purple with
pink daisies, only, having been told that grey-and-yellow
suited him wonderfully he accepted it as
a fact, said that it “looked all right, he supposed,”
and was soon a willing slave to the grey-and-yellow
habit. Mrs. Foster’s attempt to persuade her
husband to pin his taste to brown-and-lilac, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
was a wretched failure. Mr. Foster snorted
disgustedly and went right on buying green and
magenta neckties and socks that made his wife
shudder.</p>

<p>Having washed his hands and face and dried
them on a handkerchief&mdash;a soft, pure-linen affair
with a monogram worked in one corner in grey
and yellow&mdash;Myron opened his kit-bag and unpacked,
stowing the things neatly and systematically
in one of the chiffoniers. He would, he reflected,
get them to take the other chiffonier and
the other bed out. As he was to occupy Number
17 alone there was no need of them. When the
bag was unpacked and set in a corner of the closet
he donned his jacket again and strolled to a window.
The campus was livening up. Although
the foliage hid the other buildings very effectually
he could hear the patter of feet on gravel and
steps, voices in shouts or laughter and, from
somewhere, the tuning of a banjo. As he looked
down, leaning from the sill, two lads came across
the grass and paused a little further along under
a window. They were in flannels, and one carried
a racket. They tilted their heads and hailed:</p>

<p>“O Jimmy! Jimmy Lynde! He-e-ey, Jimmy!
Jimmy-y-y!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>After a moment a voice answered from a
neighbouring window: “Hello, Gus, you old
rascal! ’Lo, Petey! How’s everything?”</p>

<p>“Lovely. Come and have a game. Channing’s
over there, and he and Pete’ll play you and me.
Huh? Oh, forget it! There’s oodles of time for
that. All right, hustle along. We’ll go on over.
Get a move on!”</p>

<p>The two waved and turned toward the gymnasium.
Myron felt a trifle lonesome when they
had gone, for it came to him that he was a stranger
in a strange land. He wondered how long it
would be before fellows stopped under his window
and called to him. It probably didn’t take long
to get acquainted, he decided, but still he sort of
wished he knew at least one of his school-fellows
as a starter. Perhaps, after all, it would have
been nicer to have had a room-mate. Personally,
he hadn’t cared much one way or the other, but
his mother had exclaimed in horror at the idea
of his sharing his room with a strange boy.
“Why, you can’t tell what sort of a person he
might be, Myron dear,” she had protested. “Of
course we know that Parkinson is one of the nicest
schools and that some of the very best people
send their sons there, but nowadays it’s quite impossible
to keep the wrong sort out of anywhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
It would be awful if you found yourself with some
dreadful low kind of boy.” So Myron had said,
“Oh, all right, Mater,” and dismissed the notion.
And maybe she was right, too, for it would be a
frightful bore to have to live in such close quarters
with some “roughneck.” On the whole he guessed
he was better off alone, even if he did feel rather
lonely for a few days.</p>

<p>He recalled the fact that he hadn’t yet registered
at the Office, or wherever you did register,
but he had until six to do that, and a glance at a
handsome thin-case gold watch showed that the
time was still short of three. But it was dull up
here, and stuffy, too, and he guessed he’d go down
and look the place over. As he turned from his
window he became aware of the fact that the
dormitory was no longer quiet. Doors opened
and closed, feet shuffled on the stairs and there
were sounds of talking and singing and whistling.
It certainly sounded more cheerful, he thought.
The taxi driver had closed the door behind him,
and now Myron started across the study to open
it. Maybe if it was open some one might see him
and drop in. He put his hat back on the table,
deciding not to go out just yet. As he reached
his hand toward the doorknob there were sounds
of heavy footsteps outside. Then something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
thumped against the door, a voice muttered&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Myron pulled the portal open. Framed in the
doorway stood a veritable giant of a boy, a battered
valise in each hand, a ragged-edged stiff
straw hat tilted far back from his perspiring
countenance and a none too clean handkerchief
dangling from inside a wilted collar.</p>

<p>“Atta boy!” said the stranger genially, and
then, to Myron’s amazement, he piled into the
study, fairly sweeping the other aside, dropped
his bags with mighty thuds on the floor and
mopped his broad face with the dangling handkerchief.
“Geewhillikins, but that’s some tote,
kiddo!” he observed with an all-encompassing
grin. “I’m sweating like a horse!”</p>

<p>“It is warm,” replied Myron in a voice that
was quite otherwise. “But haven’t you&mdash;er&mdash;made
a mistake?”</p>

<p>“Watyer mean, mistake?” asked the other,
puzzled.</p>

<p>“In the room. This is seventeen.”</p>

<p>“Sure! That’s all right. I just came from the
Office. That Hoyt guy said seventeen. And, say,
kiddo, it’s some swell dive, ain’t it? Guess you
and I are lucky guys, all right, to get it, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>SO DOES JOE DOBBINS</small></h2>


<p>Myron didn’t know who “that Hoyt guy” might
be, but he was sure that he or some one else had
made a horrible mistake. Why, this big, good-natured,
badly-dressed boy was the roughest sort
of a “roughneck,” the identical type, doubtless,
that his mother had spoken of so distastefully!
Myron viewed him during a moment of silence, at
a loss for words. The newcomer had removed his
tattered hat and was now struggling with a jacket
that, far too tight in the sleeves, parted reluctantly
from the moist garments beneath. But it came
off finally and the boy tossed it carelessly to a
chair and stretched a pair of long arms luxuriously
ere he sank onto it. “That train was like
a furnace all the way, and the ice-water gave out
at Hartford,” he said. “Well, here we are,
though. What’s your name? Mine’s Dobbins;
Joe Dobbins, only they generally call me
‘Whoa.’”</p>

<p>“My name is Foster,” replied Myron rather
weakly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“Foster, eh? That’s all right. I know a fellow
at home name of Foster. Drives for Gandell
and Frye. They’re the big dry-goods folks. He’s
an all-right guy, too, Sam is. He and I used to
be pretty thick before I came away. Were you
here last year, Foster?”</p>

<p>“No, I&mdash;this is my first year.”</p>

<p>“What class?”</p>

<p>“Third, I expect.”</p>

<p>“Same here. I’m new, too. I was at St.
Michael’s last year, until April. I beat it then.
Got in wrong with faculty, you know.” He
smiled and winked. “Great little school, St.
Michael’s, but sort of narrow. My old man said
he guessed I needed more elbow-room. So I
thought I’d try this place. Looks all right so far;
sort of pretty: plenty of trees. I like trees. Grew
up with ’em. Maybe that’s why. Dad made his
money out of trees.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” responded Myron, coldly polite.
“Lumber, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Wrong, kiddo. Spruce gum.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’ve heard of him: Tom Dobbins:
the Spruce Gum King, some call him.”</p>

<p>Myron shook his head. For some absurd reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
he felt slightly apologetic, and was angry with
himself for it.</p>

<p>“No? Well, I guess you don’t come from my
part of the country. Portland, Maine’s my home.
We’ve been living there six or seven years. I
missed the woods at first a heap, let me tell you.
Why, we used to live right in ’em: big trees all
around: no town nearer than six miles. I was
born there, in a log house. So were my three
sisters. Them was the happy days, as the guy
says.”</p>

<p>“Very&mdash;very interesting, I’m sure,” said
Myron, “but about this room, Dobbins: You’re
quite certain that they told you Number 17?”</p>

<p>“Sure! Why not? What’s wrong with it?”
Dobbins gazed questioningly about the study and
then leaned forward to peer through the open
door of the bedroom. “Looks all right. Plumbing
out o’ order, or something? Any one had
smallpox here? What’s the idea?”</p>

<p>“The idea,” replied Myron a bit haughtily, “is
that I am supposed to have this suite to myself.
I particularly asked for a single suite. In fact,
I am paying for one. So I presume that either
you or I have made a mistake.”</p>

<p>Dobbins whistled. Then he laughed enjoyably.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Myron thought it was a particularly unpleasant
laugh. “Say, that’s rich, ain’t it?” asked Dobbins
finally. “No wonder you were sort of stand-offish,
kiddo! Gee, it’s a wonder you didn’t biff
me a couple and throw me out on my bean! I’ll
say it is! Butting in on your&mdash;er&mdash;privacy, like,
eh? Say, I’m sure that Hoyt guy said seventeen,
but he may have got his wires crossed. I’ll mosey
over and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother. I haven’t registered yet. I’ll
straighten it out. Maybe he meant one of the
other halls.”</p>

<p>“Might be,” said Dobbins doubtfully, “but he
sure said Sohmer. This <em>is</em> Sohmer, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Well, I’ll find out about it. Meanwhile
you might just&mdash;er&mdash;wait.”</p>

<p>“Got you, kiddo. I’ll come along, though, if
you say so. I don’t mind. I’m fine and cool now.
Maybe I’d better, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” replied Myron quickly. “You stay
here.” He repressed a shudder at the thought of
being seen walking into the Administration Building
with Dobbins! For fear that the latter would
insist on accompanying him, he seized his hat and
fairly bolted, leaving the intruder in possession
of the disputed premises.</p>

<p>The Administration Building was but a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
rods away, and Myron, nursing his indignation,
was soon there. But it was evident that he would
have to wait a considerable time, for the space
outside the railing that divided the secretary’s
office in half was well filled with returning students.
There was nothing for Myron to do save
take his place in the line that wound from the
secretary’s desk across the room and back again.
But the official, in spite of a nervous manner,
handled the registrations efficiently, and after fifteen
minutes or so, during which he was annoyedly
aware of the amused stares and whisperings of a
couple of fourth class youngsters, Myron’s turn
came. He gave his name and answered the questions
and then, when the secretary waved him
on, “There’s been a mistake made about my room,
sir,” he said. “I engaged a single suite nearly
two months ago and you wrote that I was to have
Number 17 Sohmer. Now I find that you’ve put
another fellow in with me, a fellow named Dobbin
or Dobbins.”</p>

<p>The secretary rescued the card that he had a
moment before consigned to the index at his elbow
and glanced quickly over it. “Oh, yes,” he answered.
“I recall it now. But I wrote to your
father several days ago explaining that owing to
the unexpectedly large number of students this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
year we’d be unable to give you a study to yourself.
Possibly you left before the letter reached
your home in&mdash;ah, yes,&mdash;Port Foster, Delaware.
The school catalogue states distinctly that rooms
are rented singly only when circumstances permit.
The suite assigned you is a double one and we
have had to fill it. Very sorry, Mr. Foster, but
perhaps you will find it an advantage to have a
companion with you.”</p>

<p>“But my father is paying for a single
room&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That has been arranged. One-half of the first
term rental has been refunded. That is all, Mr.
Foster?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why, I suppose so, but I don’t like it,
sir. You agreed to give me a room to myself.
If I had known how it was to be, I&mdash;I think I’d
have gone somewhere else!”</p>

<p>“Well, we’d be sorry to lose you, of course,”
replied the secretary politely, “but unfortunately
there is no way of giving you the accommodations
you want. If you care to communicate with your
father by wire we will hold your registration
open until the morning. Now I shall have to ask
you to let the next young gentleman&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I guess you’d better do that,” replied Myron
haughtily. “I’ll telegraph my father right away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>The secretary nodded, already busy with the
next youth, and Myron made his way out. As he
went down the worn stone steps he saw the two
fourth class boys adorning the top rail of the
fence that bordered Maple Street, and as he passed
them he heard a snicker and a voice asking “Isn’t
he a <em>dur-ream</em>?” His first angry impulse was to
turn back and scold, but second thoughts sent him
on with an expression of contemptuous indifference.
But the incident did not sweeten his disposition
any, and when he strode into Number 17
again it needed only the sight that met him to set
him off. Joe Dobbins, minus coat and vest, his
suspenders hanging, was sitting in the room’s
one easy chair with his stockinged feet on the
table. Myron, closing the door behind him, glared
for an instant. Then:</p>

<p>“What do you think this is, Dobbin?” he demanded
angrily. “A&mdash;a stable?”</p>

<p>Dobbins’ jaw dropped and he viewed Myron
with ludicrous surprise. “How do you mean, a
stable?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I mean that if you’re going to stay here with
me tonight you’ve got to act like a&mdash;a gentleman!
Sitting around with your suspenders down and
your shoes off and your feet on the table&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Joe, in vast relief. “That’s it! I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
thought maybe you were going to crack some joke
about me being a horse, on account of my name.
Don’t gentlemen put their feet on the table and
let their galluses down?”</p>

<p>“No, they don’t!” snapped Myron. “And as
long as you’re rooming with me&mdash;which I hope
won’t be long&mdash;I’ll ask you to cut out that ‘roughneck’
stuff.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” grinned Joe. “Anything to oblige,
Foster.” He had already dropped his feet, and
now he drew his suspenders over his shoulders
again and slipped his feet back into his shoes.
“Don’t guess I’ll ever get on to the ways of the
best circles, Foster. I’m what you call an Unspoiled
Child of Nature. Well, what did the guy
in the Office say? I’m betting I was right,
kiddo.”</p>

<p>“And don’t call me ‘kiddo’! You know my
name. Use it.”</p>

<p>“Gosh-all-hemlock!” murmured the other.
“Say, you must have one of those fiery Southern
temperaments I’ve read about. Now I know how
the Civil War happened. I’ll bet you’re a direct
descendant of General Lee!”</p>

<p>“I’m not a Southerner,” answered Myron.
“Just where do you think Delaware is?”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t know you hailed from there,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
replied Joe untroubledly, “but I’d say Delaware
was sort of Southern. Ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“No more than Maine. Look here, Dobbin&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Dobbins, please; with an S.”</p>

<p>“Dobbins, then,” continued Myron impatiently.
“That fellow over there says the school’s so full
I can’t have a room to myself. They promised
me I could two months ago, and we’ve paid for
one. Well, I’m going to get out and go somewhere
where&mdash;where they know how to treat you.
But&mdash;but I can’t leave until tomorrow, so we’ll
have to share this place tonight.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be all right,” replied Joe affably. “I
don’t mind.”</p>

<p>Myron stared. “I didn’t suppose <em>you</em> did,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Meaning <em>you</em> do, eh?” Joe laughed good-naturedly.
“That it?”</p>

<p>“I’m not used to sharing my room with others,”
answered Myron stiffly. “And I’m afraid you
and I haven’t very much in common. So I guess
we’ll get on better if&mdash;if we keep to ourselves.”</p>

<p>“All right, kiddo&mdash;I mean Foster. Anything
for a quiet life! Suppose we draw a line down
the middle of the room, eh? Got a piece of chalk
or something?”</p>

<p>“I’ve taken the chiffonier nearest the window,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
said Myron, disregarding the levity. “But I’ll
have my things out in the morning, in case you
prefer it to the other.”</p>

<p>“Chiff&mdash;Oh, you mean the skinny bureau?
Doesn’t make any difference to me which I have,
ki&mdash;Foster. Say, you don’t really mean that
you’re going to leave Parkinson just because you
can’t have a room to yourself, do you?”</p>

<p>“I do. I’m going out now to send a wire to my
father.”</p>

<p>“Gee, I wouldn’t do that, honest! Why, say,
maybe I can find a room somewhere else. I don’t
mind. This place is too elegant for me, anyway.
Better let me have a talk with that guy over there
before you do anything rash, Foster. I’m sorry
I upset your arrangements like this, but it isn’t
really my fault; now is it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” replied Myron grudgingly.
“But I don’t believe you can do anything with
him. Still, if you don’t mind trying, I’ll put off
sending that telegram until you get back.”</p>

<p>“Atta boy! Where’s my coat? Just you sit
tight till I tell that guy where he gets off. Be
right back, kiddo!”</p>

<p>Joe Dobbins banged the door behind him and
stamped away down the corridor. Pending his
return, Myron found a piece of paper, drew his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
silver pencil from his pocket and frowningly set
about the composition of that telegram. Possibly,
he thought, it would be better to address it to his
mother. Of the two, she was more likely to recognise
the enormity of the offence committed by the
school. Still, she would see it in any case if he
addressed it to the house and not to the office.
When it was done, after several erasures, it read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi">“Mr. John W. Foster, Warrenton Hall, Port
Foster, Del.</p>

<p>“Arrived safely, but find that I cannot have
room to myself as was agreed. Must share suite
with impossible fellow named Dobbins. Prefer
some other school. Not too late if you wire tonight.
Love. <span class="smcap">Myron.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>Putting Dobbins’ name into the message was, he
considered, quite a masterly stroke. He imagined
his mother’s expression when she read it!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>THE “IMPOSSIBLE FELLOW”</small></h2>


<p>Dobbins was gone the better part of half an hour
and when he finally returned his expression
showed that he had met with failure. “Still,” he
explained hopefully, “Hoyt says he will give me
the first vacancy that turns up. Sometimes fellows
have to drop out after school begins, he says.
Fail at exams or something. He says maybe he
can put me somewhere else within a week. Mind
you, he doesn’t promise, but I made a pretty good
yarn of it, and I guess he will do it if he possibly
can.” Joe Dobbins chuckled reminiscently. “I
told him that if he didn’t separate us I wouldn’t
answer for what happened. Said we’d already
had two fights and were spoiling for another.
Said you’d pitched my things out the window and
that I’d torn up all your yellow neckties. Maybe
he didn’t believe all I told him: he’s a foxy little
guy: but I guess I got him thinkin’, all right!”</p>

<p>“You needn’t have told him all that nonsense,”
demurred Myron. “He will think I’m a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not for a minute! I told him you were a perfect
gentleman. Incompatibility of temperament
is what I called it. He said why didn’t I leave off
the last two syllables. Well, that’s that, kiddo&mdash;I
mean Foster. Better leave it lay until we see
what happens, eh?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. I shall send this telegram, Dobbins.
I don’t believe he has any idea of&mdash;of doing
anything about it.”</p>

<p>“We-ell, you’re the doctor, but&mdash;Say, where’ll
you go if you leave this place?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet. There are plenty of other
schools around here, though. There’s one up the
line a ways. I think it’s called Kenwood. Or
there’s&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Kenwood? Gee, boy, you don’t want to go
there! Don’t you read the crime column in the
papers? Why, Kenwood is filled with thugs and
hoboes and the scum of the earth. A feller on the
train told me so coming down here. Parkinson
and Kenwood are rivals: get it? You don’t want
to throw down this place and take up with the
enemy, eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what that has to do with it,”
Myron objected. “I’m not a Parkinson fellow.
And I dare say that Kenwood is quite as good a
school as Parkinson.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>But Joe Dobbins shook his head. “That feller
on the train talked mighty straight. I wouldn’t
like to think he was lying to me. He said that
Kenwood was&mdash;was&mdash;now what was it he said?
Oh, I got it! He said it was an ‘asylum for the
mentally deficient.’ Sounds bad, eh?”</p>

<p>“Rot!” grunted Myron. “I’m going over to
the telegraph office.”</p>

<p>“All right. If the Big Boss drops in I’ll tell
him.”</p>

<p>When Myron had gone Joe promptly removed
coat and vest once more, dropped his suspenders
about his hips and kicked off his shoes. “Might
as well be comfortable when His Majesty’s away,”
he sighed. “Gee, but he’s the limit, now ain’t he?
I suppose I ought to have spanked him when he
called me a stable&mdash;or whatever it was. But I
dunno, he’s sort of a classy guy. Guess he isn’t
so worse if you hack into him. Bark’s a little
punk, but the wood’s all right underneath, likely.
Don’t know if I could stand living with him
regular, though. Not much fun in life if you
can’t slip your shoes off when your feet hurt.
Well, I guess I’ll get these satchels emptied.
What was it he called those bureaus, now? Chiff&mdash;chiff&mdash;I’ll
have to get him to tell me that again.
One thing, Joey: living with Mr. Foster’ll teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
you manners. Only I’d hate to think I’d ever
get to wearing a lemon-yellow necktie!”</p>

<p>Still feeling deeply wronged and out-of-sorts,
Myron made his way back to Maple Street and set
out toward the business part of Warne. The
breeze that had made the late September afternoon
fairly comfortable had died away and the maples
that lined the broad, pleasant thoroughfare
drooped their leaves listlessly and the asphalt
radiated heat. Myron wished that he had shed
his waistcoat in the room. Students were still
arriving, for he passed a number on their way
to the school, bags in hands, and several taxis
and tumble-down carriages went by with hilarious
occupants oozing forth from doors and windows.
One of the taxi drivers honked brazenly as his
clattering vehicle passed Myron and the latter
glanced up in time to receive a flatteringly friendly
wave and shout from Eddie Moses. Myron
frowned. “Folks here are a lot of savages,” he
muttered.</p>

<p>The telegram despatched, he made his way to a
nearby drug store, seated himself on a stool and
asked for a “peach-and-cream.” The freckle-faced,
lanky youth behind the counter shook his
head sadly. “Ain’t got no peach today. I can
give you vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, rasp&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“I didn’t mean syrup. Haven’t you any fruit?
I want a peach-and-cream.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know what that is. Anyway, we ain’t
got it. How about a chocolate sundae with puffed
rice? Lots of the fellers call for them.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks.” Myron descended from the stool
and went out, more than ever assured of the undesirability
of Parkinson School as a place of
sojourn. Think of a town where you couldn’t get
a peach-and-cream! Why, even the smallest shops
in Port Foster knew what a peach-and-cream was!
He cast contemptuous looks upon the modest
stores and places of business along Adams Street,
and even the new Burton Block over on the corner
of School Street, six stories high and glittering
with broad glass windows, only drew a word of
derision. “Suppose they call that thing a skyscraper,”
he muttered. “Huh! Puffed rice!”</p>

<p>Returning, he went through School Street to
Washington Avenue. The south side of that
shady thoroughfare, called Faculty Row, presented
a pleasing vista, in each direction, of neat
lawns and venerable elms and glowing beds of
flowers. Here and there a sprinkler tossed its
spray into the sunlight. Myron had to acknowledge,
albeit grudgingly, that Port Foster had
nothing prettier to offer. Facing him, across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Avenue, since School Street ended there, was the
main gate to the campus, and straight ahead a
shady tunnel roofed with closely-set linden trees
led the eyes to the gleaming façade of Parkinson
Hall, which, unlike the other school buildings, was
of light-hued sandstone and was surmounted by
an imposing dome. From the gate in front of
him two other similar paths led diagonally away,
and choosing the right-hand one Myron found
grateful relief from the sun. He removed his hat
and wiped the perspiration from his forehead with
an immaculate handkerchief, and when he had
finished returned the handkerchief to his breast
pocket very carefully, allowing a corner&mdash;it happened
to be the corner bearing the embroidered
monogram&mdash;to protrude carelessly.</p>

<p>As he neared Sohmer he passed a group of four
boys lying on the grass beneath the trees. Their
conversation dwindled as he approached, ceased
entirely as he came abreast and then went on again
subduedly after he had gone by. His former irritation
returned. What was there about him to
make fellows stare or giggle or smile? Even down
town he had noticed it, and now, although he could
not hear what was being said behind him, <a href="#image01">he felt
that he was being discussed</a>. He was conscious
of being better dressed than any of the boys he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
had seen yet, there was nothing unusual in his
looks so far as he knew and he believed that
he carried himself and walked in an ordinary
manner. He decided again that they were all a
lot of savages or “small town” gykes. He was
glad he was leaving them tomorrow.</p>

<p>Back in Number 17, he found that Dobbins had
gone out. In the bedroom that remarkable youth’s
suit of rough red-brown material&mdash;it was much
too heavy for summer wear and reminded Myron
somewhat of a horse-blanket&mdash;that he had worn
on his arrival lay carelessly tossed across a bed.
It was the bed that Myron had chosen for himself,
and he distastefully removed the clothes to the
other one. As he did so he looked for the maker’s
tag inside the collar and smiled ironically when he
read “Bon Ton Brand.”</p>

<p>“Ready-made,” he murmured.</p>

<p>Dobbins had decorated the top of his chiffonier
with two photographs and Myron examined them.
One was a group picture of four persons; a woman
rather thin and angular but with a kind and sweet
face, a girl of some fourteen years, awkward and
staring, and two younger girls, the littlest perhaps
six. All were dressed in their finest and all, at
least to Myron’s sophisticated sight, were dowdy.
He concluded that the persons were Dobbins’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
mother and sisters. The second photograph was
a more ambitious affair and showed a man of
about forty years. He had a square, much seamed
face from which two keen eyes looked straight at
the beholder. A funny little patch of beard
adorned the chin and above it a wide mouth was
drawn severely down at the corners. In the
photograph the man looked stern and hard and
even cross, Myron thought, but there was something
nice about the countenance in spite of that,
something suggesting that behind the weathered
face were clean thoughts and kindliness.</p>

<p>“That’s the Spruce Gum King,” he reflected.
“I guess if he hadn’t been scared at the camera
he’d have looked rather a fine old chap, in spite
of the little bunch of whiskers. He looks something
like Dobbins, too: same sort of eyes and&mdash;and
same expression about the chin. Only
Dobbins is more lazy and good-natured, I
guess.”</p>

<p>Later, his trunks came&mdash;there were two of them&mdash;and
he had the expressman set them behind the
door, one atop the other. There was no sense
in opening them, for his kit-bag provided all he
needed for the night. By that time it was nearing
the supper hour and there was a rustling in the
leaves of the lindens and the air was cooler. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
told himself that whether Dobbins ever returned
was nothing to him, and yet he found himself
listening for the other’s heavy tread in the corridor.
He wondered where Dobbins had gone, and
rather resented his absence. The magazine which
he had been reading beside the open window
ceased to hold his attention and he glanced at his
watch. A quarter to six. The supper hour was
six o’clock. He had looked that up in his copy of
the school catalogue. And you ate in Alumni
Hall, which, as the plan of the school showed, was
the building on the extreme left of the line. Finally
Myron stripped to his waist and had a good
splurge with soap and water. Some kindly soul
had supplied a towel and it wasn’t until he was
through using it that he saw the inscription “Dobbins”
on one end.</p>

<p>“Well, how was I to know?” he grumbled.
“Maybe I’d better dig into the trunk and get out
a few of my own.”</p>

<p>But after supper would do, and just now he was
feeling decidedly hungry, and washing up had
refreshed him and made life look more pleasant.
He hoped there would be something fit to eat, but
he didn’t expect it. He was getting back into his
clothes when the approach of his temporary room-mate
was announced from some distance down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
hall by the <em>clump-clump</em> of heavy shoes. Dobbins
was peculiarly ungentle with doors. He flung
them open and didn’t care what happened to them
afterwards. In the present case the door crashed
back against the trunks behind it with a most
annoying <em>bang</em>, but Dobbins didn’t appear to have
heard it. He was strangely attired, was Dobbins,
and Myron, one arm in his shirt, gazed in
astonishment and for a moment forgot to go on
with his dressing.</p>

<p>A faded yellowish-brown jersey with half of the
left sleeve missing and the other torn and mended&mdash;and
torn and not mended&mdash;was surmounted by
a canvas football jacket held together down the
front with a black shoe-lace and a piece of twine.
The jacket was so old and stained that Myron
could easily believe it an heirloom, something
handed down through generations of football-playing
Dobbinses! A pair of rather new khaki pants,
woollen stockings of brown twice ringed with light
blue that well matched the jersey in condition,
and scuffed and scarred football shoes completed
the costume. Dobbins’ hair was every which way
and there was more or less dirt on his broad countenance
through which the perspiration had flowed
in little rivulets with interesting results.</p>

<p>“Hello, kiddo!” Dobbins greeted jovially.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
“How’s the grouch coming on? Say, they’ve got
a swell gridiron here; two or three of ’em, in fact.
Wonderful turf. It’s a pleasure to fall on it, honest!
Hear from your old man yet?”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” replied Myron drily. “What have
you been doing?”</p>

<p>“Me? Sweating, son, mostly. Practising football
some, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I didn’t know you played.”</p>

<p>“Me? That guy Camp and I wrote the rules!
Looks like we had enough fellers to build forty
teams. Must have been ’most a thousand of ’em
over there. Every time I turned around I trod on
some one. You didn’t go over, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, I&mdash;I was busy. Besides, I didn’t know
they were holding practice today. I supposed
they’d start tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“Been at it three days already, I hear. Got a
coach here that looks like he knew his business,
Foster. Ever try football?”</p>

<p>“I’ve played some,” answered Myron, with a
smile that seemed to combine patience and pity.
“I expect to go out for it when I get settled
somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Still thinking of leaving, are you? You’re
going to lose a mighty good school, son. I sure
do like this place. Well, I’ve got a hunger like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
river-boss. Guess I’ll get back to store clothes
and find the trough. You going now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so.”</p>

<p>“Well, tell ’em to save a little of everything
for me.” Dobbins’ voice came muffled from above
the basin in the bedroom, and Myron, remembering
the towel, hurried out.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>MYRON DECIDES TO STAY</small></h2>


<p>At dining hall it appeared that places had not
yet been assigned and Myron was conducted to
a seat between a large, stout youth who seemed
afflicted with asthma and a shy, red-cheeked boy
who promptly upset his glass of milk when Myron
asked for the biscuits. Rather to his surprise,
the food was excellent and plentiful. There were
many tables, each seating ten boys, and most of
them were filled when Myron reached the hall.
There was a good deal of noise, as was natural
when nearly four hundred normally healthy boys
were being fed. At Myron’s table no one appeared
to be acquainted with any one else and in
consequence there was little conversation. The
asthmatic youth wheezily ventured a remark, but
Myron’s reply was not encouraging and the youth
gave all his attention again to dropping bits of
biscuit in his stewed pears and salvaging them
noisily. Myron was glad when the stout chap,
finding nothing else to devour, sighed heavily and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
left the table. His place was filled again, however,
a moment later by a clean-cut fellow of about
nineteen years, a good-looking, neatly-dressed boy
of what Myron mentally called his own sort. Conversation
with him seemed natural and desirable,
and Myron broke the ice by offering the biscuits.
The newcomer accepted one, said “Thanks”
politely and cast a brief and appraising glance
over his neighbour.</p>

<p>“They’re not bad,” said Myron.</p>

<p>“No, they never are,” answered the other. “I
wonder if you can reach the butter.”</p>

<p>Myron could and did. “Not up to the biscuits,”
he offered.</p>

<p>“No? What seems to be wrong with it?”</p>

<p>“Too salty for me.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, you’d naturally like it fresh.”</p>

<p>Myron shot a covert and suspicious glance at
the other. It seemed to him that there had been
a faint emphasis on the word “fresh.” Perhaps
he had only imagined it, though, for his neighbour’s
expression was quite guileless. He was
leisurely buttering a portion of the biscuit and
appeared to have forgotten Myron’s existence.
Myron felt faintly uncomfortable and applied himself
silently to his food. Across the board another
chair was pushed back and, almost before its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
occupant was out of it, again taken. Myron observed
rather annoyedly that the new occupant of
the place was Dobbins. He nodded across and
dropped his eyes to his plate. He hoped that Dobbins
wouldn’t try to converse. Somehow, he
didn’t want the chap at his right to think him a
friend of Dobbins’. But Dobbins, after an approving
look about the table, did just what Myron
had hoped he wouldn’t do.</p>

<p>“How you making out, Foster?” he inquired.
“Grub meeting your approval?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks,” responded Myron coldly.</p>

<p>“That’s good. I see you&mdash;Hello!”</p>

<p>“Hello,” said the boy at Myron’s right affably.
“How do you feel now?”</p>

<p>“Great! It sure was hot, though. Bet you I
dropped five pounds this afternoon. But I’ll get
it back right now if they’ll give me half a chance!”
Dobbins chuckled and Myron’s neighbour smiled
responsively. Myron wondered how Dobbins and
this chap beside him happened to be so chummy.
He wondered still more when, a minute later, his
neighbour changed his seat for one just vacated
beside Dobbins, and entered into an animated conversation
with him. Myron couldn’t catch more
than an occasional word above the noise of talking
and clattering dishes, but he knew that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
subject of their discourse was football. He was
glad when he had finished his supper and could
leave the table.</p>

<p>There was a reception to the new students that
evening at the Principal’s residence, but Myron
didn’t go. What was the use, when by noon tomorrow
he would have shaken the dust of Warne
from his shoes and departed for a school where
fellows of his station and worth were understood
and appreciated? Joe Dobbins, however, attended
and didn’t get back to the room in Sohmer until
nearly ten o’clock, by which time Myron had exhausted
all the reading matter he could find and,
pyjama-clad, was sitting at a window and moodily
looking out into the dimly lighted yard. Joe entered
in his usual crash-bang manner and breezily
skimmed his hat toward the table. It missed the
table and went to the floor, where, so far as its
owner was concerned, it was allowed to stay.
Myron reflected that it wasn’t hard to account for
the battered condition of that hat.</p>

<p>“Heard from your old man yet?” asked Joe,
dropping into a chair and stretching his long legs
across the floor.</p>

<p>“Meaning my father?” asked Myron stiffly.</p>

<p>“Yep. Has he telegraphed?”</p>

<p>“No, unless he’s sent a night message. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
might. Sometimes he doesn’t get back from the
yard until rather late.”</p>

<p>“Yard? What sort of yard?”</p>

<p>“Shipyard. He builds boats.”</p>

<p>“Oh, boatyard, you mean. I know a fellow
in Portland has a boatyard. Makes some crackajack
sloops.”</p>

<p>“We build ships,” corrected Myron patiently.
“Battleships, passenger ships, cargo carriers and
such. Some of them are whopping big ones: sixteen
and eighteen thousand tons.”</p>

<p>“Gosh! I’d like to see that place. I suppose
you’ll be going to work with him when you get
through here.”</p>

<p>“Not exactly. I shall go through college first,
of course.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, say, honest injun, Foster, do you
think a college course cuts any ice with a fellow?
The old man says I can go to a college&mdash;if I can
get in,&mdash;but I don’t know. I wouldn’t get through
until I was twenty-two or twenty-three, and seems
to me that’s wasting a lot of time. What do you
think?”</p>

<p>“Depends, I suppose, on&mdash;on the individual
case. If you feel that you want to get to work
in the chewing-gum factory and can’t afford to
go through college&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where do you get that chewing-gum factory
stuff?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“Why, I thought you said your father made
spruce gum.”</p>

<p>“No, the Lord makes it. The old man gathers
it and sells it. Spruce gum is the resin of spruce
trees, kiddo.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Myron vaguely. “Well, I dare say
he will need you to help him gather it. In your
case, Dobbins, going through college might be
wasting time.”</p>

<p>Joe laughed.</p>

<p>“What’s the joke?” asked the other suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Well, I was having what you call a mind picture
of the old man and me picking that gum.
Know how many tons of the stuff he handles in a
year? Nearly a hundred and thirty: about two
hundred and fifty thousand pounds! He has over
a hundred pickers employed, and buys a lot from
fellows who pick on their own hook.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Myron. “Well, how was I to know?
You distinctly said the Lord made it and your
father gathered it, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“That’s right; my error, kiddo&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Kindly cut out that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sorry; I forgot. Well, I don’t have to worry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
about college just yet, do I? We’ll see first if
I can stick here long enough to get my time! I
wouldn’t mind playing football on a good college
team, though: Harvard or Yale or Dartmouth or
one of those big ’uns.”</p>

<p>“Probably not,” replied Myron drily. “Nobody
would. I wouldn’t myself.” Somehow he
managed to convey the impression that in his case
such a thing was not only possible but probable,
but that for Joe to set his hopes so high was
absurd. Joe’s greenish-grey eyes flickered once,
but he made no comment. Instead:</p>

<p>“You played much?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Quite a bit,” answered the other carelessly.
“I captained the Port Foster High team last
fall.”</p>

<p>“Must have then! Where’d you play?”</p>

<p>“Position? Left half. End the year before
that. What do you play?”</p>

<p>“Me? Oh, most anything in the line. I’m not
fussy. Played tackle most of last year. Like to
play guard better, though. Football’s a great
game, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Not bad,” acknowledged Myron. “By the
way, who was the fellow you were so thick with at
supper tonight?”</p>

<p>“Him? Name’s Keith or something. Played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
on last year’s team and was coaching the linemen
today. Nice guy. Bet he can play, too.”</p>

<p>“Looked rather light to me,” commented
Myron.</p>

<p>“Think so? Maybe. Anyway, he knows how to
drill the line, or I’m a Dutchman. What time is
it? I’m getting sleepy. You weren’t over at the
party, were you?”</p>

<p>“No, it didn’t interest me. As I’m not going to
stay, why be bored by that sort of thing?”</p>

<p>“Hm,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“What’s ‘Hm’ mean?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Just thinking. Say, what’s your
objection to this place, Foster? If it’s just me,
why, say, I’ll get out gladly. Fellow I met tonight
told me he has a dandy room in the village. I’m
not fussy about living on the campus.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t just that,” said Myron. “I don’t
like the&mdash;the atmosphere here.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is sort of close tonight, but I guess it
would be anywhere in this part of the country.
September’s likely to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t referring to the air,” corrected the
other loftily. “I used the word in its other
sense.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t know it had another sense,” said Joe
cheerfully. “All right. But I was just thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
that if you had to have this place to yourself I
could beat it, and no hard feelings.”</p>

<p>“They’d stick some one else in here, I guess.
Besides, I wouldn’t want to put you out. After
all, you’ve got as much right here as I have, I
suppose.” That statement had a rather dubious
sound, however, and again Joe’s eyes flickered
and the very ghost of a smile hovered for an instant
about the corners of his wide mouth.</p>

<p>“Yeah, but the next chap might be more your
style, Foster. I’m sort of rough-and-ready, I
guess. Don’t run much to etiquette and wouldn’t
know what to do in one of those silk collars you
wear. I should think they’d make your neck
awfully warm.” And Joe ran a finger around
inside his own very low linen collar apprehensively.</p>

<p>“I hope I haven’t said anything to make you
think that I&mdash;that you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you haven’t <em>said</em> anything: at least,
not much: but I can see that I’d be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">persona non
compos</i>, or whatever the word is, around these
diggings. You think it over and let me know. I
guess that Hoyt guy wouldn’t mind if I got a
room outside somewhere. Well, here’s where I hit
the hay.”</p>

<p>“There’s no sense in my thinking it over,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
answered Myron a bit querulously, “as I tell you
I’m not going to stay here.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think there’s any doubt about it, eh?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not!”</p>

<p>“All right. I was only thinking that if you <em>did</em>
stay&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least intention of staying. I
wish you’d get that fixed in your mind, Dobbins.”</p>

<p>“Sure! I’ll go to sleep and dream about it!”</p>

<p>If Myron dreamed of anything he had no recollection
of having done so in the morning. He
awoke in a far more cheerful frame of mind to
find a cool and fragrant breeze flapping the curtain
and a patch of golden sunlight lying across
his bed. He had slept like a log. A glance at the
neighbouring bed showed that Joe Dobbins was
up, although Myron’s watch proved the time to
be still short of seven-thirty. From across the
campus a bell was ringing loudly. It was doubtless
that sound that had awakened him. Usually
he turned over and had a nap before getting up,
but this morning, although he buried his head in
the pillow again, sleep didn’t return to him. Perhaps
it was just as well, he reflected, for that telegram
from his father ought to be along soon, and
he would probably have a busy morning getting
away. So far he had not considered what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
would do in case they couldn’t take him at Kenwood.
He rather hoped they could, though. It
would be a big satisfaction, and an amusing one,
too, to play on the Kenwood eleven and show
these unappreciative fellows at Parkinson what
they had missed! Myron could play football and
knew it, and knew as well that in losing his services
Parkinson was losing something worth while. It
would be fun to say carelessly to some Parkinson
fellow after he had aided Kenwood to beat her
rival: “Yes, I did think of going to your school:
in fact, I actually spent a night there: but they
treated me rather rotten and I got out. They
promised me a room to myself, you know, and then
tried to make me go in with another chap. It was
rather coarse work, and I told them so before I
left.” Whereupon the Parkinson boy would tell
it around and there’d be regrets galore.</p>

<p>That was a pleasing dream, and under the exciting
influence of it Myron jumped out of bed and
sought a bath. While he was shivering in the icy
water he recalled the fact that there was such a
thing as chapel or morning prayers or something,
and he wondered if he was under obligations to
attend that ceremony. He decided the question in
the negative and, returning to his room, dressed
leisurely, selecting a grey tie with a yellow figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and a yellow handkerchief with a narrow grey
border. The bell had long since ceased its clamour
and peace had settled over the yard. Dressed,
he went downstairs. In the corridor, close by the
entrance, was a notice board and a letter rack.
He didn’t bother to peruse the few notices nor
would he have paid any attention to the rack had
his fleeting glance not been arrested by the sight
of a buff envelope. He stopped and looked more
closely. It was a telegram and, yes, it was addressed
to Myron W. Foster, Parkinson School,
Warne, Mass. In blue pencil was “S 17.”</p>

<p>At last! He took it to the entrance and paused
on the top step in the sunlight and tore off an end
of the envelope very carefully. Then he withdrew
the folded sheet of buff paper and with a satisfied
smile began to read it. But the smile vanished
in the next instant and, although he read the
message through a second and even a third time,
he could not make the sense of it correspond with
his expectation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Your mother and I very sorry about your

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>ON THE GRIDIRON</small></h2>


<p>Myron’s connection with Parkinson School began
inauspiciously. After an eleventh-hour effort to
get his studies scheduled, and the discovery that
he was required to take two courses he didn’t
want to take and to omit one that he did, a summons
came to him to visit the Office. There Mr.
Morgan, assistant to the Principal, reminded him
that attendance at chapel was compulsory and then
announced that there appeared to be some doubt
that he could enter the second class owing to the
fact that his Latin was not up to the requirements.
That was disheartening, for Myron had coached
on Latin during the summer and been pronounced
fit for the third-year class at Parkinson or any
other preparatory school. Yesterday he would
have received the announcement with unconcern,
but today, since the arrival of that disappointing
telegram, he found cause in it for real alarm. At
well past seventeen one doesn’t like to be put in
with fellows who average sixteen, Myron held.
As a matter of fact, the third class contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
more students of his age than it did of fellows
younger, and he would not have found himself out
of place there. But he didn’t know that, and as
a result he pleaded very hard to be allowed to
enter the class above. In the end, after much hesitation,
and with no very good grace, Mr. Morgan
consented.</p>

<p>“But you’ll have to do some hard work, Foster,
if you’re to stay there. Unless you’re willing to,
I’d advise you to go into the third.”</p>

<p>“I’ll work, sir. Maybe I could coach in Latin.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you could do that. If you like, I’ll give
you the address of a fellow who does a good deal
of tutoring and gets excellent results.” He wrote
the address on a slip and Myron tucked it in his
pocket. “Well, that’s all, I think. I hope you will
get on nicely, Foster. Let me see, your adviser
is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mr. Cooper, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good. Don’t hesitate to consult him. He’s a
fine man and you’ll like him immensely, I think.
Good morning.”</p>

<p>Myron had a spare hour after dinner and spent
it unpacking. When some of his things had been
distributed around the study the place really
looked fairly homelike and attractive, and he began
to look forward to a year at Parkinson with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
more equanimity. If only he wasn’t handicapped
with his Latin, he thought, things wouldn’t be so
bad. With Dobbins out of the way and the study
and bedroom to himself, he guessed he could get
along fairly comfortably. There was a half-hour
of physics at three, and after that he was through
for the day. He returned to Sohmer and changed
into his football togs, which, unlike the nondescript
garments worn by Joe Dobbins, were fairly new
and of the best materials. When he had examined
himself critically and appreciatively in the glass
he sauntered downstairs, skirted the end of the
gymnasium building and had his first real look
at the playfield.</p>

<p>Nearly twelve acres of still green turf stretched
before him, his view uninterrupted save by the
grandstand directly before him. To his left were
the tennis courts, both clay and grass, and about
them white-clad figures darted. Nearer at hand,
the blue-grey running track inclosed the first team
gridiron. Beyond that two more pairs of goal-posts
met his sight, and then the baseball
diamonds filled the balance of the field. Track and
gridirons and diamonds were already occupied,
and the nearer grandstand held a handful of boys
who had gathered in the warm sunlight to watch
the activities. Football practice was called for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
three-thirty, and it was nearly four when Myron
reached the field. He was in no hurry to join the
panting and perspiring squads that trotted around
over the turf, and so he perched himself on one
of the lower seats of the stand and looked the
situation over.</p>

<p>Not far away the manager and assistant manager,
both earnest-looking youths, talked to a stout
man in a faded brown sweater who later turned
out to be the trainer, Billy Goode. Myron wondered
where the coach might be, but he couldn’t
find any one who much resembled his idea of what
that gentleman should look like. However, with
more than a hundred fellows at work out there it
was easy enough to overlook him. A squad of
advanced players trotted near, going through
elementary signal work. Rather to Myron’s surprise,
Joe Dobbins was amongst them, sandwiched
between two capable-looking youths in togs
quite as disreputable as his. Joe was acting as
right guard, it seemed. Myron’s opinion of Joe
as a football player went up a peg, for it was fairly
evident that this squad was made up of last-year
fellows and probably contained the nucleus of
what in a few days would be known as the first
squad. About this time Myron became aware that
some of the fellows about him on the grandstand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
were viewing him curiously. Doubtless they were
wondering why, being in playing togs, he didn’t
get down there and go to work. Of course it was
none of their business, but maybe it was time he
found the coach and reported.</p>

<p>He made inquiry of the manager, a slim, very
alert youth armed with a formidable notebook
in which he was making entries when Myron approached.
“Mr. Driscoll? He’s around here
somewhere.” The manager, whose name was
Farnsworth, looked frowningly about the field.
“Yes, there he is down there, the man with the
blue sweater. Are you just reporting for practice?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Myron. “I wasn’t out yesterday.”</p>

<p>“What’s the name?” asked Farnsworth briskly.</p>

<p>“Foster.”</p>

<p>“Foster?” The manager fluttered the leaves
of the big notebook until he found the F’s. Then:
“What are the initials, Foster?”</p>

<p>“M. W.”</p>

<p>“Class?”</p>

<p>“Third.”</p>

<p>“Ever played before?”</p>

<p>“Naturally.” Farnsworth shot a quick glance.</p>

<p>“Where?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“Port Foster High School Team, Port Foster,
Delaware. I played two years there.”</p>

<p>“Line or backfield?”</p>

<p>“Backfield: before that at end.”</p>

<p>“Had your physical exam yet?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t know about it. Where do I take
it?”</p>

<p>“See Mr. Tasser, in the gym. Any time between
ten and twelve and four and six. Better do it
today. Rules are rather strict, Foster. All right.
Report to Cummins. He’s handling the new men.
You’ll find him down there by the east goal: ask
any one.”</p>

<p>“I though I’d tell the coach&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not necessary. Cummins’ll look after you.”</p>

<p>Myron shrugged mentally and turned his steps
toward the indicated location. “One of those
smart Alecks,” he thought. “Thinks he’s the
whole push. All right, it’s not my business to
tell him his. If they want me to waste my time
with the beginners it’s their funeral.”</p>

<p>Cummins wasn’t difficult to find. Myron heard
his bark long before he reached him. Nearly
thirty youths, most of them youngsters of fourteen
and fifteen, although here and there an older boy
was to be noticed, were learning to handle the
ball. Cummins appeared to be about eighteen, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
heavily-built chap with a shock of reddish-brown
hair and a round face liberally spattered with
freckles. Just now the face was scowling ferociously
and Cummins was sneering stridently at his
charges. Myron took an instant dislike to Mr.
Charles Cummins, and, or so it appeared, Mr.
Charles Cummins took an equal dislike to
Myron.</p>

<p>“Well, well, <em>well</em>, WELL!!” barked Cummins
as Myron came up. “What do you fellows think
this is? A lawn party or a sewing circle or what?
Maybe you’re waiting for the ice-cream to be
served? Listen just one minute, will you? <em>Stop
that ball</em>, you long-legged fellow! Now then, let’s
understand each other. This is football practice.
Get that? The idea is to learn to hold that ball
without having it get away from you, and to catch
it and to pass it. We aren’t doing aesthetic dancing
or&mdash;or acting in a pageant. This is <em>work</em>, W-O-R-K,
work! Any of you who are out here just
to get the air or to tan your necks can quit right
now. I’m here to show you hopeless ninnies how
to handle a football, and I propose to do it if it
takes from now to Christmas, and the sooner you
put your minds on what you’re doing and <em>try</em>
a little, the sooner you’ll get through. Now start
that ball around again and, for the love of limes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
remember some of the things I’ve told you. When
you catch it, grab it with both hands and hug it.
It isn’t an egg. It won’t break. That’s the idea,
Judson, or whatever your name is. Go ahead,
go ahead! Get some ginger into it! Pass it
along! Don’t go to sleep. I said hug it, not
fondle it, Whittier! When you&mdash;Hello, more
trouble?”</p>

<p>“The manager fellow told me to report to you,”
said Myron as Cummins turned a baleful gaze on
him.</p>

<p>“Oh, the ‘manager fellow’ told you that, did he?
What does the ‘coach fellow’ say?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen the coach yet,” answered Myron
coldly.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you? Why, say, maybe you won’t
like him! Don’t you think you ought to look him
over first? It would be fierce if you didn’t happen
to approve of him. What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Foster.”</p>

<p>“All right, Foster, you push right in there and
show me how you catch a football. Something
tells me that my troubles are all over now that
you’ve joined this aggregation of stars!”</p>

<p>Myron suppressed the angry retort that sprang
to his lips and took his place in the big circle.
“Bounder!” he muttered as he did so. The boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
next to him on the left heard and snickered, and
Cummins guessed the reason. Unseen of Myron,
he grinned. “When you can get ’em mad,” he
said to himself, “there’s hope for ’em.”</p>

<p>When the ball was passed to Myron he caught it
deftly, bending his body over it, and then promptly
sped it on to the youth who had snickered. The
latter was unaccustomed to such speed and was
not ready, and the ball bounded away. He lumbered
after it and scooped it up, returning to his
place with an accusing scowl for Myron.</p>

<p>“Think you’re smart, I suppose,” he grumbled.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” said Myron, “but you ought to be
ready for it.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? Well&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Cut out that talking!” barked Cummins.
“Speed it up, fellows!”</p>

<p>There was ten minutes more of the dreary work,
during which Myron mechanically received the
pigskin and sent it on to the next in the circle
without a hitch. If he expected to win commendation
from Cummins, however, he was disappointed.
Cummins was eloquent with criticism, but never
once did he utter a word of approval. At last:</p>

<p>“That’ll do for that, fellows,” he called. “You
may rest a minute. Maybe some of you’ll get
your strength back.” He approached Myron with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
an accusing scowl. “What are you doing in this
bunch?” he demanded. “You don’t belong
here.”</p>

<p>“I was sent here,” replied Myron warmly.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you have sense enough to tell Farnsworth
you weren’t a greenie? Think I’ve got
nothing to do but waste my time?”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re not the only one who’s doing it,
are you? What about my time?”</p>

<p>“That’s your affair. I didn’t want you, believe
me! You ought to have told him you knew
something about a football. He’s no mind-reader,
you know.”</p>

<p>“I told him I’d played two years on a high
school team&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! That explains it. You high school ginks
usually don’t know enough football to make the
first year team. Guess Farnsworth thought you
were like the run of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” replied Myron indifferently, “but
it’s not my business to teach you fellows how to
run your affairs.”</p>

<p>“Hard luck for us, isn’t it? Well, say, Mr. ’Igh
and ’Aughty, you trek across there and tell Farnsworth
I say you’re graduated from my bunch.
Get it? Tell him to put you somewhere else, and
tell him I don’t care where it is!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thanks,” returned Myron with deep sarcasm.
“I’m horribly sorry to leave you, though. It’s a
real pleasure working under such a gentlemanly
instructor, Mr. Cummins.”</p>

<p>Cummins watched him for a long moment with
his mouth open. “Well, what do you know about
that?” he murmured at last. “The cheeky beggar!”
Then he grinned again and, surprising
amused and delighted expressions on the countenances
of those of his squad who had been near
enough to overhear the conversation, quickly
changed the grin for a scowl. “All right now!”
he barked. “Line up along there. Who’s got the
ball? Let’s see what you pin-heads know about
starting.”</p>

<p>Myron’s message to Farnsworth resulted in his
finishing the practice with a group of fellows
whose education had progressed beyond the rudimentary
stage. Toward the last of the period he
was put to catching punts with a half-dozen other
backfield candidates and performed to his own
satisfaction at least. There was no scrimmage
today, nor was there any for several days following,
and at five o’clock Coach Driscoll sent them
off to the showers. Later Myron went upstairs
and found the physical director and underwent
his examination, obtaining a chart filled with perplexing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
lines and puzzling figures and official
permission to engage in “any form of athletics
approved by the Committee.” After which he
returned rather wearily to Number 17 Sohmer and
Joe Dobbins.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>“A. T. MERRIMAN”</small></h2>


<p>The next forenoon Myron set off in a spare hour
to find the tutor whose address Mr. Morgan had
given him. If he had cherished the notion of possibly
getting along without coaching in Latin his
experiences that morning had banished it. Mr.
Addicks, or Old Addie, as he was called, was a
likable sort and popular with the students, but
he was capable of a gentle sarcasm that was horribly
effective with any one whose skin was less
thick than that of a rhinoceros, and an hour or so
ago he had caused Myron to heartily wish himself
small enough to creep into a floor crack and
pull some dust over him! No use talking, Myron
told himself as he set forth for Mill Street, he’d
have to find this chap and get right to work. He
wouldn’t face that horrible Addicks again until
he had put in a solid week of being tutored. It
would get him in bad at the Office, maybe, if the
instructor called on him very often in that week,
for he would just say “Not prepared,” but anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
was to be preferred to standing up there
like a jay and letting Addicks make fun of him!</p>

<p>When he reached the head of School Street he
pulled the slip of paper again from his pocket and
made sure of the address. “A. T. Merriman, 109
Mill Street,” was what was written there. He
asked his way at the next corner and was directed
across the railroad. “Mill Street runs at right
angles to the track,” said the citizen who was
directing him. “You’ll see a granite building
after you pass the crossing. That’s Whitwell’s
Mill. The street you want runs along the farther
side of it.” Myron thanked him and went on down
School Street. The obliging citizen gazed after
him in mingled surprise and admiration.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s certainly a dressy boy,” he murmured.
“Must be Old John W. Croesus’s son!”</p>

<p>Mill Street wasn’t far and 109 was soon found,
but the character of the district wasn’t at all to
Myron’s liking. Ragged and dirty children overflowed
the sidewalks and played in the cobbled
roadway, slatternly women gossiped from open
windows, dejected-looking men lounged at the
corners, stray cats rummaged the gutters. The
houses, frame structures whose dingy clapboards
were flush with the street, had apparently seen far
better days. Now dust and grime lay thick on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
them and many a window was wanting a pane of
glass. The prospect of penetrating to such a
place every day was revolting, and, having found
the numerals “109” above a sagging porch, Myron
was strongly inclined to turn back. But he didn’t,
and a tinkle that followed his pull at the rusty
knob beside the door brought a stout and frowsy
woman who wiped her hands on her apron as she
pulled the portal open.</p>

<p>“Mr. Merriman?” inquired Myron.</p>

<p>“I don’t know is he in, sir. One flight up and
you’ll see his name on the door. If you come
again, sir, just you step right in. The door ain’t
never locked in the daytime.”</p>

<p>Myron mounted a creaky stairway guiltless of
carpet and found himself in a narrow hall from
which four doors opened. In spite of dinginess
and want of repairs, the interior of 109 was, he
had to acknowledge, astonishingly clean. One of
the doors did present a card to the inquiring gaze,
but in the gloom its inscription was not decipherable
and so Myron chanced it and knocked. A
voice answered from beyond the portal and nearly
simultaneously a dog barked sharply. Myron
entered.</p>

<p>The room was large and well lighted from two
sides. It was also particularly devoid of furniture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
or so it looked to the visitor. A large deal
table strewn with papers and piled with books
stood near the centre of the apartment where the
cross light from the two pairs of windows fell
on it. The floor was carpetless, but two scraps
of straw matting saved it from utter bareness.
There was a bench under the windows on one side
and a flattened cushion and two faded pillows
adorned it. What seemed to Myron the narrowest
bed in the whole wide world, an unlovely thing
of black iron rails, was pushed into a corner, and
beside it was a box from which overflowed a grey
blanket. Three chairs, one a decrepit armchair
from whose leather covering the horsehair stuffing
protruded in many places, stood about. There
was also a bureau and a washstand. On the end
of the former stood a small gas-stove and various
pans and cooking utensils. Books, mostly sober-sided,
dry-looking volumes, lay everywhere, on
table, bureau, window-seat, chair and even on the
floor. Between the several articles of furniture
lay broad and arid expanses of unpainted flooring.</p>

<p>At first glance the room appeared to be inhabited
only by a tall, thin but prepossessing youth
of perhaps twenty years and a Scottish terrier
whose age was a matter for conjecture since her
countenance was fairly well hidden by sandy hair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
The youth was seated at the deal table and the
terrier was halfway between box and door, growling
inquiringly at the intruder. At Myron’s entry
Merriman tilted back in his chair, thrust his hands
into his trousers pockets and said “Good morning”
in a deep, pleasant voice. Then he added
mildly: “Shut up, Tess, or I’ll murder you.” The
terrier gave a last growl and retired to the box.
As she settled down in it a series of astonishing
squeaks emerged. Myron looked across startledly
and Merriman laughed.</p>

<p>“Puppies,” he explained. “Six of them.
That’s why she’s so ferocious. Seems to think
every one who comes upstairs is a kidnapper. I
tell her the silly things are too ugly to tempt any
one, but she doesn’t believe me.”</p>

<p>“Will she let me see them?” asked Myron
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.” Merriman drew his long length
from the chair and led the way to the box. “Now
then, old lady, pile out of here and let the gentleman
have a look at your ugly ducklings.”</p>

<p>The terrier made no objection to being removed,
but the puppies cried dismally at the parting.
Myron chuckled. “Funny things!” he exclaimed.
“Why, they haven’t got their eyes open yet!”</p>

<p>“No, they’re only six days old. How’s this one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
for a butter-ball? Isn’t he a fat rascal? All
right, Tess, we won’t hurt them. I vouch for the
gentleman. He never stole a puppy in all his
innocent young life.”</p>

<p>“I never did,” Myron corroborated, “but I’d
like to start right now!”</p>

<p>“Like dogs, eh?” asked the host.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. Funny thing is, though, that I’ve
never owned one.”</p>

<p>“No? How does that happen?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. My mother thinks they’re
rather a nuisance around the house. Still, I dare
say she’d have let me kept one if I’d insisted.
I don’t suppose you&mdash;you’d care to sell one of
those?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I would. I’ll have to either sell them
or give them: unless I send them off to the happy
hunting ground.”</p>

<p>“Really? How much would they be?”</p>

<p>“The lot?” asked Merriman, a twinkle in his
eye.</p>

<p>“Gee, no! One!”</p>

<p>“Five dollars. Tess is good stock, and the
father is a thoroughbred belonging to Terrill, the
stableman on Centre Street. Got a place to keep
him?”</p>

<p>“I’d forgot about that,” owned Myron. “I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
afraid not. They wouldn’t let me have him in
Sohmer, would they?”</p>

<p>“Scarcely!” laughed the other. “All right, old
lady, back you go. Sit down&mdash;ah&mdash;What’s the
name, please?”</p>

<p>“Foster. Mr. Morgan gave me your address.
I want some tutoring in Latin, and he said he
thought you could take me on.”</p>

<p>“Possibly. Just dump those books on the seat
there. What hours do you have free, Foster?”</p>

<p>“This hour in the morning and any time in the
evening.”</p>

<p>“What about afternoon?”</p>

<p>“I’m trying for the football team and that
doesn’t leave me much time afternoons. Still, I
guess we’re usually through by five.”</p>

<p>Merriman shook his head. “I’d rather not
waste my time and yours, Foster. Football practice
doesn’t leave a fellow in very good trim for
tutoring. Better say the evening, I guess. How
would seven to nine do?”</p>

<p>“Two hours?” asked Myron startledly.</p>

<p>“Yes, you can’t accomplish much in less. I
can’t, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Seven to nine. Shall I come here
or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll come to you. What’s the number in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Sohmer? Seventeen? All right. We’ll begin
tomorrow. My terms are a dollar an hour. You
pay for the time it takes me to get to you, usually
about ten minutes. Can you arrange with your
room-mate to let us have the place to ourselves
at that time?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” replied Myron confidently.</p>

<p>“Good. Now pull your chair over here, please,
and we’ll see what the job is.”</p>

<p>Merriman had a lean face from which two dark
brown eyes looked keenly forth. His mouth was
broad and his nose straight and long. A high
forehead, a deep upper lip and a firmly pointed
chin added to the general effect of length. You
couldn’t have called him handsome, by any stretch
of the imagination, but there was something attractive
in his homeliness. Perhaps it was the
expression of the eyes or perhaps the smile that
hovered continuously about the wide mouth. He
dressed, Myron reflected, as wretchedly as Joe
Dobbins: more wretchedly, in fact, for Joe’s
clothes were at least new and good of their kind,
whereas Merriman’s things were old, frayed, ill-fitting.
His trousers, which bagged so at the
knees that they made Merriman look crooked,
had been a positive shock to the visitor. But in
spite of attire and surroundings, Myron liked this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
new acquaintance. Above all, he liked his voice.
It was deep without being gruff and had a kind
of&mdash;of pleasant kindliness in it, he thought. After
all, it was no fault to be poor if you couldn’t help
it, he supposed; and he had known fellows back
home&mdash;not intimately, of course, but well enough
to talk to&mdash;who, while poor, were really splendid
chaps.</p>

<p>Presently Merriman finished his questions and
finished jotting down little lines and twirls and
pot-hooks on a scrap of paper. Myron rather
wished he knew shorthand too. It looked ridiculously
easy the way Merriman did it. “All right,
thanks,” said the latter as he laid his pencil down.
“I think I know what we’ve got ahead of us.
Frankly, I don’t see how they let you into the
third with so little Latin, Foster. But we’ll correct
that. How are you at learning, by the way?
Does it come easy or do you have to grind
hard?”</p>

<p>“Why, I think I learn things fairly easily,”
replied Myron doubtfully. “Of course, Latin
looks hard to me because I’ve never had much
of it, but I think&mdash;I hope you won’t find me too
stupid.” Afterwards, recalling the visit, it struck
him as odd that he should have said that. Usually
he didn’t trouble greatly about whether folks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
found him one way or another. He was Myron
Foster, take him or leave him!</p>

<p>“I shan’t,” answered Merriman. “I’ve had all
sorts and I always manage to get results.”</p>

<p>“Do you do much tutoring?” Myron asked.</p>

<p>“A good deal. Not so much now as later.
Spring’s my busy time.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think you’d have time for your
own studies.”</p>

<p>“I’m not taking much this year. Only four
courses. I could have finished last spring, but I
wasn’t quite ready for college then. By the way,
if you hear of any one wanting a nice puppy I
wish you’d send them to me. I can’t keep all that
litter and I’d hate to kill the poor little tykes.”</p>

<p>“I will,” Myron assured him. “And&mdash;and I’m
not sure I shan’t buy one myself. I suppose I
could find some one to keep him for me.”</p>

<p>“I think so. Well, good morning. Say good-bye
to the gentleman, Tess.”</p>

<p>The terrier barked twice as Myron closed the
door behind him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>WITH THE AWKWARD SQUAD</small></h2>


<p>“Sure! That’s all right,” said Joe Dobbins. “If
I want to dig I can trot over to the library or somewhere.
Seven to nine, you said?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it won’t be for very long, I guess:
maybe only a couple of weeks. Merriman seemed
an awfully clever sort of a chap.”</p>

<p>“Must be if he can teach Latin! I never did see
the good of that stuff, anyway.” Joe fluttered the
pages of the book he had been studying. After
a moment he said: “Say, Foster, you’re a sort of
sartorial authority&mdash;how’s that for language, eh?&mdash;and
you know what’s what in the line of clothes,
I guess. Now I wish you’d tell me honestly if
there’s anything wrong with the things I wear.
They look all right to me, but I notice two or three
of the fellows sort of piping ’em off like they were
wondering about ’em. What’s wrong with the
duds?” And Joe glanced over the grey suit, with
the large green and blue threads running through
it, that he was wearing.</p>

<p>“Why, they&mdash;&mdash;” But Myron paused. Three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
days before he would not have hesitated to render
a frank opinion of the clothes; would have welcomed
the opportunity, in fact: but this afternoon
he found that he didn’t want to hurt Joe’s
feelings.</p>

<p>“Spit it out, kiddo&mdash;I mean Foster! Let’s know
the worst.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose they’re good material and well
made, Dobbins, but the fact is they&mdash;they’re different,
if you see what I mean.”</p>

<p>“I don’t. What <em>do</em> you mean, just? Style all
wrong by Fifth Avenue standards?”</p>

<p>“By any standard,” replied Myron firmly.
“They look ready-made.”</p>

<p>“But, gee, they <em>are</em> ready-made! I never had a
suit made to order in my life. Why should I?
I’m not hump-backed or&mdash;or got one leg longer
than the other!”</p>

<p>“Some ready-made clothes don’t look it,
though,” explained Myron. “Yours do. Did you
get them in Portland?”</p>

<p>“Sure. We’ve got some dandy stores in Portland.”</p>

<p>“Did that suit come from the best one?” asked
Myron drily.</p>

<p>“N-no, it didn’t, to tell the hideous truth.”
Joe chuckled. “You see, the old man has a friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
who runs a store and we’ve both got sort of used
to dealing with this guy. He’s a pretty square
sort, too; a Canuck. Peter Lafavour’s his name.
But I guess maybe Peter doesn’t know so much
about style as he makes out to, eh? I always sort
of liked these duds, though: they’re sort of&mdash;er&mdash;snappy,
eh?”</p>

<p>Myron smiled. “They’re too snappy, Dobbins.
That’s one out with them. Then they don’t fit
anywhere. And they look cheap and badly cut.”</p>

<p>“Aside from that they’re all right, though?”
asked Joe hopefully.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, although gentlemen aren’t wearing
pockets put on at an angle or cuffs on the sleeves.”</p>

<p>“And Peter swore that this suit was right as
rain!” sighed Joe. “Ain’t he the swine? How
about my other one?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s better cut and hasn’t so many queer
folderols,” answered Myron, “but it looks a good
deal like a grain-sack when you get it on, old
man.”</p>

<p>“What do you know about that!” Joe shook
his head dismally, but Myron caught the irrepressible
twinkle in his room-mate’s eyes.
“Guess I’ll have to dig down in the old sock and
buy me a new outfit,” he continued. “I suppose
those tony-looking duds you wear were made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
order, eh? Think your tailor could make me a
suit if I wrote and told him what size collar I
wear?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not, but I saw a tailor shop in the
village here today that looked pretty good. Why
not try there?”</p>

<p>“Blamed if I don’t, kid&mdash;Foster! I don’t suppose
you’d want to go along with me and see that
I get what’s right? I’d hate to find I had too
many buttons on my vest&mdash;I mean waistcoat&mdash;when
the things were done!”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind,” answered Myron after an imperceptible
moment of hesitation, “although you
really won’t need me if the chap knows his business.
No first-class tailor will turn you out anything
that isn’t correct.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, but&mdash;well, I’d feel easier in my mind if
I had you along. Maybe tomorrow, eh? Somehow
these duds I’ve got on don’t make such a
hit with me as they did! Coming over to the gym?
It’s mighty near time for practice.”</p>

<p>“In a minute,” answered Myron carelessly.
“You run along.” Then he reflected that if he was
to go with Joe to the tailor’s the next day he might
just as well start in now and get used to being
seen with him. “Guess I’m ready, though,” he
corrected. “Come on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>The distance from Sohmer to the gym was only
a matter of yards, and it wasn’t until the two
reached the entrance of the latter building that
they encountered any one. Then, or so Myron
imagined, the three fellows who followed them
through the big oak door looked curiously from
Joe’s astounding attire to his own perfectly correct
grey flannels. He was glad when the twilight
of the corridor was reached, and all the way
down the stairs to the locker-room below he was
careful to avoid all suggestions of intimacy with
Joe.</p>

<p>Football was still in the first rather chaotic
phase. An unusually large number of candidates
had reported this fall, and, while in theory it
was a fine thing to have so much material to select
from, in reality it increased the work to be
done tremendously. On the second day of school
one hundred and twelve boys of all sizes and
ages and all degrees of inexperience were on
hand, and coach, captain and trainer viewed the
gathering helplessly. Today a handful of the
original number had dropped out of their own
accord, but there were still nearly a hundred left,
and when Myron, having changed to his togs, followed
the dribble of late arrivals to the field he
wondered what on earth would be done with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
all. Perhaps Coach Driscoll was wondering the
same thing, for there was a perplexed frown on
his face as he talked with Billy Goode and contemplatively
trickled a football from one hand to
the other.</p>

<p>Myron rather liked the looks of Mr. Driscoll.
So far he had not even spoken to the coach and
doubted if the latter so much as knew of his
existence, but there was something in the coach’s
face and voice and quick, decisive movements that
told Myron that he knew his business. “Tod”
Driscoll was about thirty, perhaps a year or two
more, and had coached at Parkinson for several
seasons. He was a Parkinson graduate, but his
football reputation had been made at Yale. He
was immensely popular with the students, although
he made no effort to gain popularity and
was the strictest kind of a disciplinarian. Today,
while Myron, pausing at the edge of the crowded
gridiron a few yards distant, viewed him and
speculated about him, the coach showed rather
less decision than usual, for twice he gave instructions,
once to Billy and once to the manager, and
each time changed his mind.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to find more instructors,” Myron
heard him say a trifle impatiently. “How about
you, Ken? Know enough football to take a bunch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of those beginners over to the second team gridiron?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not, Coach,” answered Kenneth
Farnsworth.</p>

<p>“You don’t need to know much. What do you
say, Billy? Who is there? I’ve got most of the
veterans at work already, and there isn’t one of
them that shouldn’t be learning instead of teaching.”</p>

<p>Myron didn’t hear the trainer’s reply, for at
that moment a well-built, light-haired, somewhat
harassed youth of apparently nineteen strode up
to the group. “Look here, Coach,” he began before
he was well within talking distance, “what
about the backs? We’ve got to have some get-together
work before Saturday’s game, haven’t
we? Cater says you’ve got him in charge of a
kindergarten class, Brown’s sewed up the same
way, Garrison hasn’t shown up&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know, Cap. But what are we going to do
with this raft of talent? Some one’s got to take
hold of them, and I can’t take more than twenty.
Cummins is about ready to go on strike&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> a mess, isn’t it?” Captain Mellen turned
and viewed the scene puzzledly. “The worst of it
is that there probably aren’t a dozen in the whole
lot worth troubling with.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“True, but we’ve got to find the dozen,” answered
Mr. Driscoll. “We can’t afford to miss
any bets this year, Cap. We’ll call the first-choice
backs together at four. That’ll give us half an
hour for kindergarten stuff. But I want a couple
more fellows to take hold. Who are they?”</p>

<p>“Search me! Why not double them up, sir?”</p>

<p>“They’ve been doubled up&mdash;or pretty nearly.
Cummins has about thirty to look after and Cater
twenty-four or five. That’s too many. Sixteen’s
enough for a squad. How about Garrison?”</p>

<p>“He isn’t here. I don’t know what&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He’s cut,” interposed Farnsworth. “Got a
conference at four.”</p>

<p>“Conference! Gee, why couldn’t he have that
some other time?” asked Jud Mellen.</p>

<p>“Time to start, sir,” said Farnsworth, looking
at his watch.</p>

<p>“All right, let’s get at it. But I wish I could
think&mdash;Who’s that fellow there, Mellen?” Mr.
Driscoll dropped his voice. Mellen turned and
looked at Myron and shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t know him, Coach. Who is he,
Ken?”</p>

<p>“I think”&mdash;Farnsworth turned the pages of
his book until he had found the F’s&mdash;“I think his
name is Forrest. No, Foster. High school fellow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Two years playing. Passed a corking physical
exam.”</p>

<p>“Foster!”</p>

<p>Myron, who had been aware that he was under
discussion, joined the group. “Yes, sir?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Think you could take about twenty fellows
over to the next field and show them how to handle
the ball? You know the sort of stuff, don’t you?
Passing, falling, starting and so on. Want to try
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I can do it all right.”</p>

<p>“Good! We’ve got such a mob here today that
we’re short-handed. Stick to me a minute and
I’ll round you up a bunch.”</p>

<p>“You can’t call him exactly modest, can you?”
asked the manager of Billy Goode when the others
had walked away. “‘I can do it all right,’ says
he.”</p>

<p>“How do you know he can’t?” asked Billy.
“And if he can there ain’t any harm in his saying
so, is there? Say, if I was starting my life over
again, my friend, I’d say yes to everything like
that any one asked me. I missed a lot of good
chances by being too modest.”</p>

<p>“And truthful?” laughed Kenneth.</p>

<p>“Let it go at modest,” said Billy smiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Myron received eighteen boys as his portion and
led them across to the second team gridiron and
set to work. Four other awkward squads adorned
the field, the nearer one being under the care of
Charles Cummins. Myron smiled secretly when
he saw the surprised stare with which Cummins
regarded him. When their glances met Cummins
nodded shortly. To put his class through the
third lesson was no trick for Myron, but it was
dreary and tiresome work. It seemed to him that
Coach Driscoll must have deliberately apportioned
to him the stupidest boys on the field, for of all the
awkward squads Myron had ever had anything to
do with his was the awkwardest. But some few
presently began to respond to treatment and by
the time they were jumping out of the line and
digging knees and elbows and shoulders into the
turf in the effort to land on the trickling pigskin
he felt that he hadn’t done so badly with them.
He didn’t say much to them, for his own experience
had shown him that too much instruction and
criticism only confused the pupil, and neither
did he try to impress them with their stupidity.
As a result, most of them eventually forgot to be
self-conscious and tried to follow instructions.
Watching, Myron heard a voice at his elbow and
looked around into the face of Cummins, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
giving his own charges a moment of rest, had
walked across unnoticed.</p>

<p>“How do <em>you</em> like it?” Cummins inquired
shortly.</p>

<p>“There are other things I’d rather be doing,”
replied Myron. He didn’t feel particularly
friendly toward this chap who had badgered him
so a day or two before, and his tone showed it.
A smile flickered around the corners of Cummins’
mouth.</p>

<p>“Main thing,” he said gravely, “is to be patient
with them. I find that pays best.”</p>

<p>Myron turned and looked at him wonderingly.
“That sounds well,” he replied sarcastically.
Cummins grinned.</p>

<p>“Got it in for me, haven’t you?” he said.
“Don’t blame you&mdash;er&mdash;Whatever Your Name Is.
I was never cut out for a teacher. Besides, I
want to get to work myself. What’s your line?
Tackle?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Whatever I get, I suppose.
Try that again, you chap. Get started quicker.
I played half-back last year.”</p>

<p>“Guard’s my game. Well, I guess I’d better
go back and hound those fellows some more. See
you again, Foster, if I live.”</p>

<p>Myron wondered why Cummins had pretended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
not to recall his name at first. “Just to be as
disagreeable as possible, I guess,” he concluded.
Cummins’ hectoring voice floated across the field
just then: “All right, my hearties! Line up again
and, for the love of limes, look intelligent if you
can’t act so!”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the awkward squads were
called to the bench and Myron went to work on
Squad D or E, he didn’t know which it was, and
trotted around the field behind a shrill-voiced
quarterback, practising a handful of elementary
plays that he already knew by heart. He wondered
how long it would be before some one in
authority discovered that they were wasting the
time of a first-class half-back!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>JOE TALKS SENSE</small></h2>


<p>Parkinson played Mapleton the first Saturday
after the opening of school and had no difficulty
in scoring as she pleased, confining herself mainly
to old-style line-bucking attack. Mapleton was
not, however, a strong opponent, and the final
score of 18 to 0 was not particularly complimentary
to the home team. There was much ragged playing
on both sides, for neither team had had more
than a week of preparation. Parkinson started
with four of last year’s players in the line and
two behind it. The substitutes, of whom many
were used before the contest was over, were not
notably brilliant, with the possible exception of a
lad named Keene, who went in as left end in the
final five minutes, and of Joe Dobbins who played
a steady game at right tackle for the entire fourth
period. Myron, watching from the bench with
half a hundred others, viewed Joe’s success with
mingled emotions. He was rather surprised at
Joe’s skill, but he was not a little disgruntled at
the ease with which that raw youth had attained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
his success. Here was he, Myron, still kicking his
heels with the fourth or fifth squad, while Joe,
who played no better and knew no more football,
was already chosen as possible school team material.
Myron secretly thought it a “raw deal.”
He had become fairly reconciled to remaining at
Parkinson, but this afternoon he again began
to suspect that his talents and merits were not to
receive the consideration they deserved and to
wish that he had been able to go elsewhere. They
had worked him off on the kindergarten class as
instructor two afternoons and he had received no
thanks for his labours. Aside from that, he had
received no sort of recognition. He might just as
well be one of the raw recruits! He suspected
that it might pay him to push himself forward a
little: he believed that Joe had done that. But
then Joe was just the sort of chap who would
see nothing out of the way in self-advertisement.
Although Myron held a very good opinion of himself
as a football player he considered it beneath
his dignity to beg for favours. If Coach Driscoll
couldn’t discover talent for himself then he could
do without it. “I’ll give them another week or
so,” decided Myron, “and then if they haven’t
given me a show I’ll quit.”</p>

<p>He was rather chilly toward Joe that evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The Latin was progressing well. Merriman saw
that it did. He arrived like clockwork every evening
save Sunday at exactly ten minutes past
seven, spread his books and papers without the
loss of a minute and had no breath for extraneous
matters. “Good evening” was the extent of his
small-talk. After that it was business with him.
When, on the occasion of his first appearance in
17 Sohmer, Myron asked him how the puppies
were getting along, Merriman frowned and said:
“You aren’t paying me to talk puppies, Foster.
Have you found the page?” Having finished the
two-hour session, Merriman dropped his books
into a green-cloth bag, took up his hat, said “Good-night,
Foster,” and went. That, at least, was the
usual procedure, but this Saturday night he
varied it. When he had pulled the string of that
green bag close he laid it beside his hat and
asked: “Doing anything?”</p>

<p>“Doing&mdash;oh, no, not a thing,” answered Myron.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll stick around a few minutes.” Merriman
pulled a chair toward him and settled his
feet on it and sighed luxuriously. “I suppose
you saw the game this afternoon. You told me
you were out for the team, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Myron’s voice may have sounded disgruntled,
for Merriman smiled faintly and asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Working you too hard?”</p>

<p>“No, they aren’t working me at all,” replied
Myron bitterly. “I mean, all I’m doing is going
through a lot of stunts I learned two years ago.
I guess things are sort of balled up this year.
They’ve got so many candidates out there that
they can’t begin to handle them all, and I dare say
I’ll be just where I am in November&mdash;if I stay.”</p>

<p>“Cheer up,” said the other. “They’ll let you
go before that.”</p>

<p>“But, hang it, Merriman, I’ve played the game
for two years: more than that, counting when I
was a kid: and I was captain of my team last year.
That may not mean much to these fellows here,
but at least it ought to secure me a chance to
show what I can do.”</p>

<p>“Seems so. Doesn’t it? I mean, aren’t you
getting a chance?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not,” answered Myron warmly. “I’m
fuddling around with about fifteen or sixteen
other fellows, most of whom never saw a football
until a week ago, and getting nowhere. No
one pays any attention to you here. They just say
‘Report to Jones or Smith or some one’ and forget
all about you.”</p>

<p>“Hm. Why not tell Driscoll you want a real
try-out?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why can’t he see that I deserve one? It isn’t
my place to select his players for him!”</p>

<p>“N-no, but if there are so many candidates that
he’s likely to overlook you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Merriman was interrupted by the entrance of
Joe Dobbins. It was well after nine and Joe
thought he was privileged to return home. Finding
Merriman still there, however, he hesitated at
the door. “Hello! I thought you were through,
Foster. I’ll beat it.”</p>

<p>“We are through,” said Merriman. “I’m going
myself in a minute.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right. Don’t let me scare you away,
though.”</p>

<p>Myron performed the introduction and the two
boys shook hands.</p>

<p>“Glad to know you,” said Joe heartily. “Any
guy who knows enough Latin to teach it to others
can have my vote every time!”</p>

<p>Myron frowned. He wished that Joe wouldn’t
talk so much like a rowdy, and he glanced at Merriman
to see how that youth had taken his room-mate’s
breeziness. Apparently Merriman was
neither pained nor surprised. Instead, he was
regarding Joe with smiling interest. “Thanks,”
he said, “but being able to teach Latin to others
doesn’t amount to much, Dobbins. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
other fellow knows a little less about any subject
than you do you can trust a lot to bluff.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t that the truth?” exclaimed Joe, flinging
himself into a chair. “Look at Foster there.
He’s been teaching a lot of poor dubs how to catch
a football, and I dare say they think he invented
the game!” He winked at the visitor and grinned
at Myron. The latter, however, was not feeling
kindly enough toward Joe to take the joke gracefully.
He flushed and scowled.</p>

<p>“I dare say I know as much football as some
fellows who played this afternoon,” he said huffily.</p>

<p>“Right you are, kiddo! But that isn’t saying
a whole lot. Some of those guys were pretty
green, I thought. Did you see the game?” He
looked at Merriman and the latter shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, I would have liked to, for, although I never
played, I’m a regular football fan. But I don’t
have much time for the games. I take it that you
played today.”</p>

<p>“Me? A little. They put me in for the last
quarter. Guess they didn’t have any one else.”</p>

<p>“Where do you play?” asked Merriman.</p>

<p>“Tackle, guard, anywhere around there. It’s
a great game, football. I’d rather play it than&mdash;than
study Latin! Say, you’re the guy that has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the puppies, aren’t you? Foster was telling
me. I’d like to see ’em. I’m crazy about
dogs.”</p>

<p>“Come around some day,” replied Merriman
cordially. “You’ll find me in usually between
nine and ten and one and two.”</p>

<p>“I’ll just do that little thing,” Joe agreed.
“Gee, if I had a place to keep one of ’em I’d fall
for it. Maybe if I find a room outside I’ll buy
one off you.”</p>

<p>“Glad to sell you one, Dobbins. I’ve got five
that I don’t need. Well, I must be getting
back. By the way, I’m home all the morning tomorrow.
If you like to drop around I’ll be glad
to show you my children.”</p>

<p>“It’s a go,” said Joe heartily. “Have ’em all
dressed up for company, eh? I’ll be there.”</p>

<p>“Nice guy,” observed Joe when Merriman had
taken his departure. “I sure do like a fellow
that looks cheerful. Ever notice how many of the
chaps here look like they’d just eaten a sour
pickle, Foster? It doesn’t cost a cent more to
look cheerful, either.”</p>

<p>“Your idea of looking cheerful is to grin like a
codfish all the time,” growled Myron. “I’d rather
look the other way.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Ever have a good look at a codfish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
kiddo? He looks as sour as&mdash;as you do this
minute! Has his mouth all drawn down, you
know. Maybe he’s a real merry sort of a guy when
he’s in the water, but he sure doesn’t look that
way when he’s out of it!”</p>

<p>“Never mind how I look,” said Myron sharply.
“And cut out that ‘kiddo.’ I’ve spoken about
that often enough.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right. My error.” Joe winked gravely
at the lamp. After a moment he asked: “When’s
that furniture of yours coming?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. It should have been here before
this. Why?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. I was just wondering. I was looking
at a room on Union Street this afternoon. A
fellow’s got it now, but the dame says he’s going
to move out next week. I’d have to furnish it
myself, of course. I suppose furniture costs a
good bit, eh?”</p>

<p>“Some of it,” answered Myron.</p>

<p>“Maybe I could get some second-hand things,
though. I wouldn’t need much. The trouble
with the dive is that it has only one window and
that looks out on a back yard full of washing.
There’s something sort of&mdash;of dejecting about a
lot of clothes on a line. Don’t know why, either.
How’d you like the game?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, I guess.”</p>

<p>“How did I do?”</p>

<p>“You know as well as I, don’t you? I wasn’t
watching you particularly.”</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” chuckled Joe. “I thought
every one was watching me hard. Anyway, the
guy I played opposite was! That was an easy
bunch, though. Their backs weren’t on the job at
all. Maybe I wouldn’t rip them up if I was their
coach! They say next Saturday’s game will be
a real one, though. Hope they let me in again.
How are you coming on, by the way?”</p>

<p>“I’m not coming on,” said Myron. “I’m getting
a bit sick of it, and if they think I’m going
to stand much more of their silly nonsense they’re
mistaken. I’m all right to coach a lot of greenies,
it seems, but after that I can whistle. I wouldn’t
mind if I couldn’t play as well as half the fellows
that were in the game today.”</p>

<p>“I guess your time’s coming,” said Joe consolingly.
“They’ll be weeding them out next
week, and when they’ve got rid of about forty of
them they’ll be able to see what’s left.”</p>

<p>“If they don’t hurry I won’t be one of those
left,” said Myron grumpily, “and that’s flat. I
wish I’d stuck to my first scheme and gone to
Kenwood. There are fewer fellows there and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
maybe a chap might have a chance to get somewhere.”</p>

<p>Joe shook his head disapprovingly. “I’m glad
you didn’t do that,” he said. “Sort of sounds
like treason or something. Say, how’d you happen
to change your mind, anyway? Old man kick at
it?”</p>

<p>Myron had not gone into particulars regarding
his decision to remain at Parkinson but had told
Joe that “he guessed he’d try to stick it out.” If
Joe had surmised the real reason for the overnight
change of heart he had kept the fact to himself.
Now Myron hesitated. He didn’t want the real
reason known nor did he want to tell Joe a lie.
So he answered: “There wasn’t any kick, but as
you spoke of going to the village I thought&mdash;that
is&mdash;my father thought&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, he knew about that, eh?”</p>

<p>“Who? About what?”</p>

<p>“Your father: about me thinking of getting a
room outside.”</p>

<p>“Not exactly, only he thought I might get a
place to myself later.”</p>

<p>“You’re a punk liar, Foster,” laughed Joe.
“The old man put your little scheme on the blink
when he telegraphed to you. Now didn’t
he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“About that,” confessed Myron a bit sheepishly.</p>

<p>“Sure! I knew it all the time. And he was
dead right, too. I’m going to talk sense to you,
Foster, whether you get sore or not. The trouble
with you is that folks have made you think you’re
something a little bit better than the common run
of fellows. You’ve always had everything you’ve
wanted and you’ve been kept pretty close to the
old million dollar hut, and I guess when you were
a youngster you didn’t have many fellows to play
around with because your folks thought they might
be sort of rough and teach you to throw snowballs
and wrestle and all those vulgar things. And
you’re the only kid, too, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Myron loftily, “but if you’ll kindly
mind your own business&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Shan’t,” said Joe unruffledly. “You listen a
minute. What I’m telling you’s for your own
good, just like everything nasty. Being an only
kid with rich parents and servants to tuck your
napkin around your neck and everything is
mighty hard on a fellow. It&mdash;it mighty near ruins
him, Foster! You aren’t exactly a ruin&mdash;yet,
but you’re sure headed that way. Why, doggone
you, why ain’t I good enough to room
with? What you got that counts that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
ain’t got! Same number of arms and legs,
eh? Wear about the same size hat, don’t we?
Some fellows would have punched your head if
you’d lorded it over ’em the way you did over
me that first day. Why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You try it!” said Myron wrathfully.</p>

<p>“Well, you look like a fair scrapper, but I don’t
believe you ever had a good fight in your life.
Anyway, that’s not the question. What I want
to know is where you got your license to act like
you’re better than the next guy. Money don’t
make you that way, nor classy clothes, nor knowing
how to get into a limousine without falling
over your feet. Hang it, Foster, you’d be all
right if you’d just forget that your old man owns
a ship-yard and get it into your bean that other
fellows are human even if they wear hand-me-downs
and would try to shake hands with the
butler! Think it over, old horse, and see if I
ain’t right.”</p>

<p>“I don’t have to think it over. You ‘ain’t’
right.” Myron laughed contemptuously. “You
think&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I’m likely to say ‘ain’t’ when I get excited,”
replied Joe, “but I’ll get over that in
time.”</p>

<p>“You think that just because I wear decent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
clothes I’m stuck-up,” protested Myron hotly.
“I’ve never said or pretended that I am better
than&mdash;than any one else! As for rooming with
you, I explained that. I was to have a room to
myself. That was understood.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Joe soothingly. “But when
you found you couldn’t be by yourself why didn’t
you face it like a sport! And why turn up your
nose as if they’d asked you to bunk in with the
Wild Man of Borneo?”</p>

<p>“I’d just as lief,” sputtered Myron. “He
wouldn’t be any wilder than you are!”</p>

<p>“Yeah, but wait till you see me in those new
duds we ordered,” said Joe pleasantly. “Maybe
you’ll be real proud of me then. Wouldn’t wonder
if you’d almost speak to me when there’s other
fellows looking!”</p>

<p>Myron flushed and his eyes fell. “That’s a
rotten thing to say, Dobbins,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“True, though, ain’t&mdash;isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t!”</p>

<p>“My mistake then. Sorry. Well, I’m for the
old bed. I suppose I might have kept my mouth
shut and minded my own business, like you said,
but that mess of talk’s been sort of accumulating
ever since we came together and I feel better for
getting rid of it, whether you do or not! Sorry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
if I said anything to hurt your feelings, Foster.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry. You didn’t. What you say
doesn’t cut any ice with me.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s no harm done, eh? Nor good
either. It may make you happier to know that
I’ve decided to take that room I told you about,
though. The guy that’s in it now moves out next
Friday and faculty’s given me leave to change.
That ought to give you sweet dreams, eh?”</p>

<p>“It will,” replied Myron acidly.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>MYRON LOSES HIS TEMPER</small></h2>


<p>The next morning Joe was as cheerful and smiling
and good-natured as ever, but Myron wasn’t
yet ready to forget, and his responses to his room-mate’s
overtures were brief and chilling. After
breakfast, which on Sundays was a half-hour
later, Joe suggested that Myron walk over to the
village with him and visit Merriman and see the
puppies. Myron wanted to go, for the day was
chill and cloudy and generally depressing, but
his pride wouldn’t let him and so he answered
shortly that he had seen the puppies and he
guessed they hadn’t changed much. When Joe
had taken himself off Myron felt horribly out-of-sorts
and was heartily glad when church time
came and, immaculately but soberly attired, he
could set forth across the campus. Dinner was at
one o’clock, a more hearty repast than most of the
fellows needed after a morning spent in comparative
idleness. However, no one skimped it.
Myron went right through from soup to ice-cream,
becoming more and more heavy and gloomy under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the effects of an overloaded stomach. He had
been placed at a table near the serving-room doors,
and, while some of his companions declared that
you got your things quicker and hotter by being
so close to the source of supplies, Myron disliked
having the doors flap back and forth directly behind
his back and detested the bursts of noise and
aroma that issued forth at such times. Today he
resented those annoyances more than ever and
found the conversation about him more than ordinarily
puerile.</p>

<p>There were a good many third class boys at his
table, fellows of fourteen and fifteen, whose deportment
was anything but staid. They were
much given to playing practical jokes on each
other, such as surreptitiously salting a neighbour’s
milk or sprinkling pepper in his napkin.
And they were not above flicking pellets of bread
when the nearest faculty member was not looking.
Each table had a “Head” whose duty it was
to see that proper decorum was observed. In
some cases the Head was one of the faculty, in
other cases he was an older boy. The Head at
Myron’s table was a second class chap named
Rogers, a stoutish, easy-going fellow who was
generally so busy eating everything he could lay
hands to that he had no time for correcting his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
charges. It was unfortunate that young Tinkham,
the pink-cheeked, sandy-haired little cherub who
sat almost opposite Myron, should have selected
today for his experiment with the bread pellet.
Tinkham had longed for days to see if he could
lodge a pellet against Myron’s nose. To Tinkham
that nose looked supercilious and contemptuous
and seemed to fairly challenge assault. Until
now Tinkham had never been able to summon sufficient
courage to dare the sacrilege, but today
there was a demoralising atmosphere about and
so when, having eaten his ice-cream and having
nothing further to live for anyway, he saw
Myron’s gaze wander toward the further end of
the hall Tinkham drew ammunition from under
the edge of his butter dish and with an accuracy
born of long practice let fly. His aim proved
perfect. Myron dropped his spoon and sped a
hand to his outraged nose. Before him, perched
on the remains of his ice-cream, was the incriminating
missile, and of all those who had witnessed
the deed only one remained unsmiling, demure
and innocent, and that one was the cherubic, fair-haired
Tinkham.</p>

<p>Myron lost his temper instantly and completely.
“That was you, Tinkham! I saw you!” The
latter statement was hardly truthful, but Tinkham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
didn’t challenge it. He only looked surprised and
pained. “You try that again and I’ll box your
silly little ears for you! Remember that, too!”
Myron flicked the bread pellet disgustedly aside
and glowered at the offender.</p>

<p>“<em>Boo!</em>” said one of Tinkham’s friends, and the
younger element became convulsed with laughter.
At that, Rogers, who had been bending absorbedly
over his dessert, looked up.</p>

<p>“Cut that out, fellows,” he remonstrated feebly.</p>

<p>“We’re only laughing,” giggled one of the boys.</p>

<p>“Wake up, Sam,” said Eldredge, who was
Rogers’ age and had viewed the proceedings with
unconcealed amusement. “You’re missing all the
fun. If you didn’t eat so much&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If he didn’t eat so much he might keep order
at the table,” said Myron.</p>

<p>Rogers was too surprised to reply, but Eldredge
took up the cudgels in his behalf. “Oh, don’t be
a grouch, Foster,” he sneered. “The kid didn’t
hurt you. It was only fun.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the kind, then,” answered Myron
haughtily. “After this he can leave me out of his
‘fun.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, piffle! Come back to earth! If I’d been
Tinkham I’d have shied the whole loaf at you.
Then you’d have had something to kick about.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“The something would have been you, then,”
retorted Myron.</p>

<p>“Would it? Is that so?” Eldredge glared
angrily across the table. “Think you’re man
enough to kick me, do you? Why, say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Dry up, Paul!” begged Rogers. “Tasser’s
got his eye on you.”</p>

<p>“I won’t dry up,” retorted the insulted
Eldredge. Nevertheless he dropped his voice beyond
the hearing of the neighbouring instructor.
“If that stuck-up mollycoddle thinks he can talk
about kicking me and get away with it he’s all
wrong, believe me!” The younger boys were listening
in open delight and Tinkham was fairly
squirming with excitement. “Get that, Foster?”</p>

<p>“I heard you,” replied Myron indifferently.</p>

<p>“You did, eh? Well, any time you feel
like&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Rogers, what’s wrong at your table?” It was
Mr. Tasser’s voice, and Eldredge stopped suddenly
and gulped back the rest of his remark.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;that is, nothing, sir,” stammered the
Head. Then, to Eldredge in an imploring whisper:
“Shut up, will you?” he begged. “Want to
get me in wrong?” Eldredge muttered and shot
venomous looks at Myron while the youngsters
sighed their disappointment. Myron folded his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
napkin and arose leisurely, aware of the unsympathetic
regard of his companions, and walked out.
In the corridor he waited for a minute or two. He
had no desire to carry matters any further with
Paul Eldredge, but he felt that if he hurried
away that youth might misconstrue the action.
However, Eldredge didn’t appear and so Myron
went across to Sohmer, still sore and irritated, to
find an empty study. Eldredge’s failure to follow
Myron out of the dining hall had been due entirely
to discretion. With Mr. Tasser’s penetrant and
suspicious gaze on him, he decided that it would
be wise to avoid all seeming interest in Myron.</p>

<p>Joe failed to return to the room, and after trying
to do some studying and finding that he simply
couldn’t keep his mind on his task, Myron pulled a
cap on and sallied forth again. It was misting by
then, and a chilling suggestion of autumn was in
the air. When he had mooned along the country
road that led toward Cumner for a mile or so without
finding anything of interest he turned back
toward the town. A hot chocolate in a corner
drug store restored his spirits somewhat and, having
no better place to go, he crossed the railroad
and made his way through the dreary quarter that
held the residence of Merriman. He didn’t suppose
Merriman would be in, but it was something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to do. Recalling former instructions, he didn’t
bother to ring the bell this time, but opened the
door and climbed the dark stairway to the second
floor. That Merriman was in became known to
him before he had groped his way to the room,
for from beyond the closed portal came the sound
of voices. For a moment Myron hesitated. He
hadn’t bargained on finding visitors there. But
the loneliness of Number 17 Sohmer on this Sunday
afternoon decided him, and he knocked. Merriman’s
voice bade him enter and he opened the
door on a surprising scene.</p>

<p>On the decrepit window-seat reclined Joe Dobbins.
Close by, in the room’s one armchair, with
his feet on a second chair, was Merriman. Between
the two was a corner of the deal table,
dragged from its accustomed place, and on the
table was the remains of a meal: some greasy
plates, a coffee pot, cups, bits of bread, about a
third of a pie, a half-eaten banana, a jar of milk.
The room, in spite of a wide-open window, smelled
of sausages. On Joe’s chest reposed Tess, the
terrier, evidently too full of food and contentment
to bark, and in Merriman’s lap was a squirming
bunch of puppies.</p>

<p>“Come in, Foster,” called the host genially.
“Pardon me if I don’t get up, but just now I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
weighted with family cares. Find a chair and
draw up to our cosy circle. Have you had food?
There’s some pie left, and I can heat some coffee
for you in a second.”</p>

<p>“I’ve had dinner, thanks, a good while ago.”
He carefully lifted a dozen or so books from a
chair and took it across to the window. He felt
rather intrusive. And there was Joe grinning at
him from the seat, and he was supposed to have
a grouch against Joe.</p>

<p>“Well, have a piece of pie, won’t you?” begged
Merriman hospitably. “Sure? We were sort of
late with our feed. What time is it, anyway?
Great Scott, Dobbins, it’s nearly four! How long
have we been sitting here?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been here ever since I worried down
that last piece of pie,” said Joe, “and I guess
that was about an hour and a half ago. You ought
to have showed up earlier, Foster. You missed a
swell feed!”</p>

<p>“Sausages and potatoes and pie,” laughed
Merriman. “Still, we managed to nearly kill ourselves:
at least, I did.” Joe groaned and shifted
the terrier to a new position. “Been for a walk,
Foster?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It’s a rotten day, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Is it?” Merriman glanced through the window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
in faint surprise. “I hadn’t noticed. Sort of
cloudy I see. By the way, I’ve sold one of these
little beggars.”</p>

<p>“Have you? They’ve got their eyes open,
haven’t they?”</p>

<p>“Sort of half open,” chuckled Merriman.
“Maybe they’re too fat to open them any wider.
This is the one that’s sold. His name is&mdash;what was
it you named him, Dobbins?”</p>

<p>“Zephaniah,” answered Joe gravely, “Zephaniah
Q. Dobbins.”</p>

<p>“What’s the Q for?” laughed Merriman.</p>

<p>“Haven’t decided yet. I just put that in for
the sound. You see, Foster, I’m calling him
Zephaniah after an old codger who used to live
near us up at Hecker’s Falls, Maine. Zephaniah
Binney was his name. He used to be a cook in the
logging camps, but he got so fat tasting the
things he cooked that he had to quit. After that
he used to sit in front of his shack all day, tilted
back in a chair, and look for work.”</p>

<p>“Look for work?” laughed Merriman.</p>

<p>“Yeah, he was always on the look-out for a
job. ’Most strained his eyes looking. But somehow
he never found one; leastways, he hadn’t
when I saw him last. Funny old codger. Warren
Wilson, who was postmaster and ran the store and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
one thing and another, used to bring the Bangor
paper to Zeph every day and Zeph would study
the advertisements mighty carefully. Guess he
knew more about the Bangor labour market than
any man alive. ‘I was readin’ where one o’ them
big dry-goods houses is wantin’ a sales manager,’
Zeph would tell you. ‘It don’t say how much
they’re willin’ to pay, though. If I knew that I’d
certain’y communicate with ’em, I would so.
Maybe they’ll make mention o’ the salary tomorrow.
I’ll just wait an’ see.’”</p>

<p>“And he’s still waiting?” chuckled Merriman.</p>

<p>“As far as I know.”</p>

<p>“What does he live on?” asked Myron. “Has
he got money saved?”</p>

<p>“No, he’s got something better; he’s got an
up-and-coming wife who works just as hard as
Zeph&mdash;looks. She’s a wonderful woman, too, Mrs.
Binney is. She’s lived with Zeph thirty years or
more and she ain’t&mdash;hasn’t found him out yet.
Or, if she has, she don’t let on. If you ask her
has Zeph got a job yet she’ll tell you, ‘No, not
yet, but he’s considerin’ acceptin’ a position with
a firm o’ commission merchants down to Boston.’
And all the considering Zeph has done is read
an advertisement in the Bangor paper where it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
says the Boston folks want a few carloads of
potatoes!”</p>

<p>“It’s sort of tough on the puppy, though,”
murmured Myron.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s a strong resemblance between
him and Zephaniah,” said Joe. “I’ve been
watching him. He doesn’t push and shove for his
food like the rest of them. He just waits, and
first thing you know he’s getting the best there
is. If that ain’t like Zeph I’ll eat my hat.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going to keep him?” inquired
Myron.</p>

<p>“In my room&mdash;when I get it. He won’t want
any better than I have, I guess. I don’t suppose
he’s going to kick because there isn’t much of a
view.”</p>

<p>Merriman asked about the new quarters and Joe
supplied a drily humorous description of them.
The room began to grow dark and the boy’s faces
became only lighter blurs in the twilight. Tess
went to sleep and snored loudly. Myron listened
more than he talked, conscious of the comfortable,
home-like atmosphere of the queer, illy-furnished
room and putting off from minute to minute the
return to school. But at last the town clock struck
six and Joe lifted the terrier from his stomach,
in spite of protests, and swung his feet to the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve got to be going,” he announced.
“Haven’t peeked into a book since Friday.” He
yawned cavernously. “You coming along,
Foster?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so.” Myron was glad to be
asked, but he was careful to keep any trace of
cordiality from his voice.</p>

<p>“Well, come again,” said Merriman heartily.
“Both of you. Sunday’s an off-day with me
and you’ll usually find me in about noon.”</p>

<p>“Me? I’ll be back,” declared Joe. “I haven’t
enjoyed a meal since I left home like I enjoyed
that dinner. Brother, you sure can cook sausages!”</p>

<p>“I like that guy,” said Joe when he and Myron
were traversing the poorly-lighted street that led
toward school. “He don’t have any too easy a
time of it, either, Foster.”</p>

<p>“No, I guess coaching isn’t much fun,” Myron
agreed.</p>

<p>“Well, he told me he liked it. Maybe he has
to. He says he’s put himself clean through school
that way. His father and mother are both dead
and the only kin he’s got is an old aunt who lives
out West somewhere. He says she’s got a right
smart lot of money, but the only thing she ever
does for him is send him six handkerchiefs every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Christmas. Says it’s a big help, though, because
he doesn’t have to buy any. He’s a cheerful guy,
all right, and the fellows hit on a swell name for
him.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Myron.</p>

<p>“Why, his name is Andrew Merriman, you
know, and so they call him ‘Merry Andrew.’
Cute, ain’t it? He works hard every summer, too.
Last summer he was a waiter at a hotel and did
some tutoring besides. He’s a hustler. Doggone
it, Foster, you’ve got to hand it to a guy like
that!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Myron agreed. Mentally he wondered
that Merriman didn’t choose a less menial task
than waiting on table. It seemed rather demeaning,
he thought. Joe was silent until they had
reached the end of School Street and were entering
the campus gate. Then:</p>

<p>“Say, I’d like to do something for him,” he
said earnestly. “Only I suppose he wouldn’t let
me.”</p>

<p>“Do something? What do you mean?” asked
Myron.</p>

<p>“Well, help him along somehow. Fix it so’s he
wouldn’t have to work all the time like he does.
The guy’s got a great bean on him. Bet you he
knows more than the Principal and the rest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the faculty put together. A fellow like that ought
to be able to go ahead and&mdash;and develop himself.
See what I mean? He’s too&mdash;too valuable
to waste his time serving soup and fish in a summer
hotel. If I did it it wouldn’t hurt none, but
he’s different. If I had my way I’d fix him up
in a couple of nice rooms with plenty of books and
things and tell him to go to it.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t just see how you could do anything
much for him,” said Myron.</p>

<p>“No, I guess he wouldn’t let me.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not. Anyway, it would take a good
deal of money, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I guess so. Well, I’m just talking. No
harm in that, eh? I’m not going over to supper.
I couldn’t eat anything more if I was paid for it.
See you later, kiddo.”</p>

<p>For once Myron failed to resent that form of
address. In fact, he scarcely noticed it. Going
across to Alumni Hall, he found himself looking
forward with something akin to dismay to the
time when Dobbins should have left him to the
undisputed possession of Number 17!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>THE CHALLENGE</small></h2>


<p>Myron had quite forgotten Paul Eldredge and the
incident of the bread pellet and only remembered
when he seated himself at table and caught
Eldredge’s unfriendly stare. As he was late,
Eldredge and the others were nearly through the
rather modest repast, and smiles and whispers
across the board appraised him of the unpleasant
fact that he was suspected of having delayed his
arrival in order to avoid encountering his table
companions. Being far from the truth, this displeased
him greatly and as a result he bore himself
more haughtily than ever, thereby increasing
the disfavour into which he had fallen at noon.
Young Tinkham raised a snigger amongst his
cronies by ostentatiously rolling a bit of biscuit
into a pellet, but he didn’t throw it. Presently
Myron was left alone, to his satisfaction, Eldredge
passing him with a challenging look that would
have given him cause for thought had he seen it.
At the moment, however, Myron was looking into
the bottom of his cup and so had no forewarning
of what was to occur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>If Eldredge was in the corridor when he came
out ten minutes later Myron didn’t see him. It
was not until he was half-way along the walk
toward Sohmer that he again recalled Eldredge’s
existence. Then he heard his name spoken and
turned. Two fellows came toward him, the lights
of Goss Hall behind them so that it was not until
they had reached him that he recognised them as
Eldredge and Rogers. It was Eldredge who had
called and who now spoke.</p>

<p>“Been looking for you ever since dinner, Foster,”
said Eldredge accusingly. “Kept sort of
scarce, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>Rogers laughed softly, nervously. Myron
stiffened.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t have looked very hard, Eldredge.
I was in my room&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, no you weren’t!” interrupted Eldredge
triumphantly. “I looked there.”</p>

<p>“Until half-past three&mdash;or three.”</p>

<p>“Or half-past two&mdash;or two,” mocked the other.</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?” asked Myron coldly. He
knew now that Eldredge intended trouble. “What
did you want me for?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing much. I just wanted to give you
something.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want it, thanks,” replied Myron. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
turned to go on, but Eldredge stepped in front
of him.</p>

<p>“Don’t, eh? Wait till you know what it is,
Mister Smug!” Eldredge’s arm shot out. Although
he had not guessed the other’s intention,
Myron caught sight of the movement and instinctively
stepped back. The blow, aimed at his face,
landed lightly on his chest. Prompted by a rage
as sudden as Eldredge’s attack, Myron’s right
hand swept swiftly up from his side and caught
his opponent fairly on the side of the face with
open palm. The sound of the slap and Eldredge’s
snarl of mingled surprise and pain came close
together. Staggered by the blow, Eldredge fell
back a pace. Then he sprang forward again.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;” he stammered wildly.</p>

<p>But Rogers, stout and unwieldy, threw himself
between in a panic of entreaty. “Don’t, Paul!
Not here! Some one’s coming! You’ll get the
very dickens! You crazy dub, will you quit?
<em>Paul</em>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t!” grunted Eldredge, trying to
shove Rogers aside. “He can’t hit me and get
away with it! I’ll show him&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Let him alone,” said Myron.</p>

<p>“No! Aw, quit, Paul! Honest, some one’s
coming down the line. It won’t hurt you to wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
a minute, will it?” Rogers was panting now from
the double exertion of being a human barrier and
a suppliant. But he won, for Eldredge, almost
as angry with his friend for delaying revenge as
with his enemy, but utterly unable to get past
him, stopped his efforts in despair.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, wait a minute?” he demanded,
alternately glaring at Rogers and Myron.</p>

<p>“Well, wait until tomorrow,” panted Rogers.
“You know what’ll happen if you fight here. Do it
regular, Paul.”</p>

<p>“Tomorrow! Where’ll he be by that time?”
asked Eldredge scathingly.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” cautioned Rogers hoarsely.
“You’ll have a crowd here in a minute!” Already
a group of three fellows had paused a little way
off and were peering curiously through the darkness.
“Listen, will you? You fellows can settle
this just as well tomorrow as you can now. Fix
it up for the brickyard at&mdash;at what time do you
say, Foster?”</p>

<p>“Any time he likes!” answered Myron obligingly.
Then, remembering that there were such
things as recitations, he added: “Before breakfast:
say a quarter to seven.”</p>

<p>“You won’t want any breakfast when I get
through with you,” growled Eldredge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“That all right for you, Paul?” asked Rogers.
By this time he was leading the others by force of
example along the walk.</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Good! A quarter to seven, then, at the brickyard.
Come on, Paul. So long, Foster!”</p>

<p>Myron made no answer as he strode on toward
Sohmer. His pulses were still pounding, although
he had managed to control his voice fairly well,
and he was experiencing a sort of breathlessness
that was novel and not altogether unpleasant.
But, to be truthful, contemplation of tomorrow
morning’s engagement with Eldredge at the brickyard,
wherever that might be, did not fill him with
unalloyed bliss. In fact, as excitement dwindled
something very much like nervousness took its
place. Myron was not a coward, but, as he climbed
the stairs in Sohmer, he found himself wishing
that he had kept his temper and his tongue under
control yesterday noon!</p>

<p>Joe Dobbins, with both lean, sinewy hands
desperately clutching his tousled hair, was bent
over a book at the study table. Joe’s method of
studying was almost spectacular. First he removed
his coat, then his collar and tie. After
that he seated himself on the edge of his chair,
twined his ankles about the legs of it, tilted it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
forward until his elbows were on the table, got a
fine, firm grip on his hair with each hand, took a
long agonised breath&mdash;and plunged in! Studying
was just as hard for him as it looked, and it is
greatly to his credit that he succeeded at it as
well as he did. Just now he looked up at Myron’s
entrance. For a moment he stared vacantly.
Then his hands dropped from his head, the chair
thumped back into normal position and he came
out of his trance.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he said vaguely.</p>

<p>“Latin?” asked Myron.</p>

<p>“Math,” was the sad response. Then, sensing
something unusual about his room-mate, he asked:
“What’s up?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Why?”</p>

<p>“You look like some one had dropped a firecracker
down your neck, or something. What’s
disturbed your wonted calm? Say, how’s that?
‘Wonted calm!’ Gee, that’s going some, ain’t it?
I mean, is it not?”</p>

<p>“Great,” said Myron absently. He went into
the bedroom and methodically changed coat and
vest for a grey house jacket. When he emerged
Joe was still unsatisfied.</p>

<p>“Going to study?” asked the latter.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;no&mdash;I don’t know. I ought to.” But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Myron seated himself at the window instead of at
the table and took one leg into his interlaced
hands. Joe watched him solicitously. After a
minute Myron asked with elaborate unconcern:
“Did you ever fight any one, Dobbins?”</p>

<p>“Me?” Joe chuckled. “Well, I’ve been in a
couple of scraps in my time. Why?”</p>

<p>“Just wondered. What&mdash;how do you go at it?”</p>

<p>“Me?” Joe leaned precariously back in his
chair. “Well, I ain’t got but one rule, Foster,
and that’s: Hit ’em first and often.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I&mdash;I suppose boxing is&mdash;quite an art.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know much about boxing, kiddo. Where
I come from they don’t go in for rules and regulations.
When you fight&mdash;you fight: and about the
only thing that’s barred is kicking the other fellow
in the head when he’s down! A real earnest
scrap between a couple of lumber-jacks is about
the nearest thing to battle, murder and sudden
death that you’re likely to see outside the
movies!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean that sort of fighting,” said
Myron distastefully. “Fellows at&mdash;well, say, at
school don’t fight like that, of course.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t suppose so. I guess they stick to
their fists. Anyway, they did where I went to
school. We used to have some lively little scraps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
too,” added Joe with a reminiscent chuckle. “I
remember&mdash;But, say, what’s your trouble, Foster?
Why are you so interested in fighting?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was just wondering,” answered Myron
evasively.</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know all about that. Who you been
fighting?”</p>

<p>“No one.”</p>

<p>“Who you going to fight?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t said I was going to fight, have I?
I was just asking about it. Maybe I might have
to fight some time, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sure, that’s so. You might. You can’t ever
tell, can you?” Joe picked up a pencil and beat
a thoughtful tattoo on the blotter for a moment.
Then: “Who is he? Do I know him?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Know who?” faltered Myron.</p>

<p>“This guy that’s after you. Come on, kiddo,
open up! Come across! Let’s hear the
story.”</p>

<p>So finally Myron told the whole thing, secretly
very glad to do it, and Joe listened silently, save
for an occasional grunt. When Myron had finished
Joe asked: “So that’s it, eh? Tomorrow
morning at a quarter to seven at the brickyard.
Where’s this brickyard located?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I must ask some one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yeah. Now tell me this, kid&mdash;I mean Foster:
What do you know about fighting?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” owned Myron ruefully. “I saw a
couple of fellows at high school fight once, but
that’s about all.”</p>

<p>“Never fought yourself?”</p>

<p>Myron shook his head almost apologetically.
“No, I never had occasion to.”</p>

<p>Joe snorted. “You mean you never had a
chance to find an occasion,” he said derisively.
“You were kept tied up to the grand piano in the
drawing-room, I guess. Think of a husky guy
like you getting to be seventeen years old and
never having any fun at all! Gee, it’s criminal!
Your folks have got a lot to answer for, Foster,
believe me! Here, stand up here and put your
fists up and show me what you know&mdash;or don’t
know.”</p>

<p>Myron obeyed and faced the other awkwardly.
Joe groaned.</p>

<p>“Gee, ain’t you the poor fish? Stick that foot
out so you can move about. That’s it. Now I’m
going to tap you on the shoulder, the left shoulder.
Don’t let me!” But Myron did let him, although
he thrashed both his arms about fearsomely.
“Rotten! Watch me, not my hands. Now look
out for your face!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>A minute later Joe dropped his hands, shook
his head and leaned dejectedly against a corner of
the table. “It’s no use, kiddo, it’s no use! You’ll
be the lamb going to the slaughter tomorrow.
Ain’t any one ever taken the least interest in your
education? What are you going to do when that
Eldredge guy comes at you?”</p>

<p>Myron smiled wanly. “I guess I’ll just have to
do the best I can,” he said. “Maybe he isn’t much
better than I am.”</p>

<p>“Don’t kid yourself. When a guy picks a quarrel
the way he did it means he knows a bit. Still,
at that&mdash;&mdash;” Joe stopped and stared thoughtfully
at the wall. Then: “What’s his full name?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Paul Eldredge is all I know of it.”</p>

<p>“That’ll do. I’ll be back in a few minutes.”
Joe picked up his cap and made for the door.
“Nothing like knowing what you’re up against,”
he said. “Sit tight, Brother, and leave this to
me. If I was you I’d do a bit of studying, eh?”</p>

<p>Myron followed the advice. Just at first it was
hard to get his mind on lessons, for his thoughts
kept recurring to the coming encounter and when
they did he squirmed uneasily in his chair and felt
a kind of tingling sensation at the end of his
spine. On the football field Myron had often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
taken blows and given them in the excitement of
the game. He had had some hard knocks and
had seen plenty of rough playing. He couldn’t
remember ever having been afraid of an opponent,
although he had more than once entered a contest
with the knowledge that the enemy was “laying
for him.” But, somehow, this was different.
What resentment he had felt against Paul
Eldredge had passed, and so even the spur of
anger was lacking. He would have to stand up
there tomorrow morning and be knocked around
at Eldredge’s pleasure, it seemed, for no very
good reason that he could think of. It was rather
silly, when you came to consider it calmly.
Eldredge had been rude to him, he had been rude
to Eldredge, Eldredge had struck him, he had
struck Eldredge. Now when things were nicely
evened up he must take a licking! Well, he supposed
there was no way out of it short of acting
like a coward. He would have to take what was
coming to him, getting off as easily as he could,
and try to like it! Well, he had taken punishment
before and could again. Having reached that conclusion,
he managed to get his thoughts back to
his studies and was going very well when Joe
returned.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>MYRON MISSES AN ENGAGEMENT</small></h2>


<p>“Well, I’ve got his number,” announced Joe,
discarding his cap and dropping into a chair.
“He’s a scrapper. He’s had three or four mix-ups
since he has been here, usually, as near as I
can make out, with fellows who didn’t know much
fighting. He’s got a quick temper and is ugly
when he’s started. He’s a second class fellow
and plays hockey and baseball. Had a fuss with
the baseball coach last spring and was laid off for
awhile. Apologised and got back again finally.
I didn’t hear any one say he was liked much.
The main thing, though, is that he can scrap.
Keith says he’s quite a foxy youth with his fists;
says he thinks he’s taken lessons. So now we
know where we are, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it seems so,” answered Myron. “Well,
there’s no use talking about it, is there? Did you
find out where this brickyard is?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, it’s just across the street at the far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
side of the campus, back from the road a bit.
I’ve been thinking, Foster. There’s no sense in
you going up against a fellow who knows how to
fight, is there?”</p>

<p>“No, but it doesn’t seem to be a question of
sense,” replied Myron, smiling.</p>

<p>“What I mean is, it isn’t a fair proposition
for a chap who can’t even keep his guard up to
try to fight a guy who knows all the ropes. Might
as well expect one of Merriman’s puppies to fight
a bull-dog. That’s so, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t quite that bad,” said Myron.
“At least, I hope not!”</p>

<p>“Mighty near. So here’s my plan, kiddo. You
stay right in your downy couch tomorrow morning
and I’ll see this guy Eldredge myself.”</p>

<p>“<em>What?</em>”</p>

<p>“Sure! Why not? He wants a scrap, don’t he?
Well, he wouldn’t get any if you were to go. It
wouldn’t be worth his trouble getting out of bed.
But me, I can show him a real good time, likely.
I don’t say I can lick him, for they tell me he’s a
right shifty guy and has some punch, but I can
keep him interested until he’s ready to call it a
day. Besides, I ain’t had a real good scrap since
last winter and I’m getting soft. So that’s what
we’ll do, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Myron laughed. Then, perplexedly, he asked:
“You aren’t in earnest, Dobbins?”</p>

<p>“Sure, I’m in earnest? What’s the joke?”</p>

<p>“I guess it would be on Eldredge,” chuckled
Myron.</p>

<p>“That’s so.” Joe smiled too. “He will be a
bit surprised, won’t he? Maybe he will be peeved,
too. I wouldn’t wonder. Well, that’s nothing in
our young lives, eh? We’re doing the best we can
for him.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but do you really think I’d agree to
that?” asked Myron. “You’re joking, of course!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, joking?” demanded the
other indignantly. “And why wouldn’t you
agree? Ain’t it the sensible thing to do?”</p>

<p>“Maybe, but I can’t do it, of course, Dobbins.
You must see that. Why, hang it, if I challenge
another fellow to fight I don’t expect him to send
a substitute!”</p>

<p>“What you expect don’t cut any ice, kiddo. If
the guy you challenge can’t fight a little bit he’s
a plain idiot to let you whang him around, ain’t
he? And if he knows another guy who doesn’t
mind taking his place why ain’t it all right and
fair for him to send him along? Tell me those!”</p>

<p>“Why, because&mdash;because it isn’t!” answered
Myron impatiently. “Eldredge hasn’t anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
against you. His quarrel is with me. What would
he say about me if I stayed away and let you go
instead?”</p>

<p>“Him? What could he say? I’ll tell him you’re
no scrapper. That’ll fix that in his mind, won’t
it? Mind you, Foster, I ain’t saying he’s going
to be pleased at running up against a guy who
knows a thing or two about the game, but it don’t
seem to me that we need to worry about whether
he’s pleased or not. He wants a scrap and we’re
giving him one. That’s enough, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“It’s the craziest thing I ever heard of,” said
Myron. “Of course, I’m awfully much obliged,
Dobbins. I appreciate it, honest. I don’t know
why you should offer to do it, either. But it’s
absolutely out of the question. So let’s not talk
about it any more.”</p>

<p>Joe frowned, opened his mouth, closed it again
without speaking and fell to studying his hands.
After a moment Myron asked: “What do I do
when I get there, Dobbins? Do we shake hands
or&mdash;or just start in?”</p>

<p>“Start in,” answered the other absently.
“Look here, Foster,” he continued earnestly,
“you’re going to act like a plumb fool. Why, that
guy’ll paste you all over your face and leave you
looking like a raw beefsteak! Then faculty’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
want to know what you’ve been doing and there’ll
be all sorts of trouble on tap. What you going
to do when he begins lamming you?”</p>

<p>Myron shrugged. “Stand him off the best way
I can. Lamm him back if I can. Maybe I’ll get
on to the game after awhile. I’m going to try.
I thought maybe you could show me a few things
tonight, just so’s I wouldn’t look too green tomorrow.
It isn’t late, is it?”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t late.” Joe brightened perceptibly
for an instant, but then his face fell again and he
shook his head. “It wouldn’t be any use, kiddo.
You’d forget it all in the morning. I guess if you
won’t do like I said the best thing’ll be to let him
knock you down as soon as possible. When you’re
down, stay down. If he asks have you had enough,
you tell him yes. Then you can shake hands and
get through without getting all beat up.”</p>

<p>“Is that what you’d do?” asked Myron sharply.</p>

<p>“Me? Well, I&mdash;I don’t know as I would, just.”</p>

<p>“Then why should you think I’d do it? Who
told you I was a coward? I can’t fight, and I
know it, but I don’t intend to lie down!”</p>

<p>“Whoa, Bill! I ain’t said you were a coward.
I know better, of course. If you were a coward
you’d try to squirm out of meeting the fellow,
wouldn’t you? All right, have it your own way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
kiddo. Only don’t worry about it, see? You get
a good sleep and leave tomorrow look after itself.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. I’m going to do that, Dobbins. Guess
I’ll turn in now and dream I’m Jess Willard or
one of those guys&mdash;fellows. Are you going to
study some more?”</p>

<p>Joe nodded. “Yeah, I’m going to study some.
Good night.”</p>

<p>“Good night,” answered Myron. A few
minutes later he spoke again from the bedroom.
“I say, Dobbins!”</p>

<p>“Yeah?”</p>

<p>“I’m awfully much obliged. You’ve been
mighty kind, you know.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, kiddo,” growled Dobbins.
“Go to sleep.”</p>

<p>Whether Myron dreamed that he was a prizefighter,
or dreamed at all, he didn’t remember
when he awoke. That he had slept restfully,
however, he realised the instant he was in possession
of his faculties. He told himself that he
felt fine. And when, a second later, he remembered
the engagement at the brickyard the empty
feeling at the pit of his stomach lasted but a
moment. He turned his head and glanced at the
clock on top of his dresser. Then he stared at
it. It said twenty-eight minutes after six! It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
wasn’t like that clock to go wrong. It had been
all right last evening when he had wound it, too.
Suppose it was still right! Suppose he had overslept!
He looked quickly at Joe’s bed. It was
empty. Great Scott! He’d have to hurry if he
was to get to that brickyard in seventeen minutes!
He started to throw the covers aside, but he didn’t.
He couldn’t! He couldn’t move his arm! Why,
he couldn’t move any part of him except his head!
Something awful had happened to him! Fright
gripped him and in a panic he strove to get command
of his limbs. Horrible thoughts of paralysis
came to him. The bed creaked, but he remained
flat on his back! And then it dawned on him that
the reason he couldn’t move was because he was
tied down!</p>

<p>For a moment he was so relieved to discover
that the fault was not with him that he didn’t
realise his situation. It was only when he remembered
the time again that he understood.
This was Joe Dobbins’ doing! Joe had tied him
down to his bed, though how he had done it without
awakening him Myron couldn’t imagine, and
had himself gone to meet Eldredge! Surprise
gave way to anger and mortification. What would
Eldredge think of him? All Joe’s explanations
would fail to convince Eldredge that Myron had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
not purposely stayed away. Of all the crazy,
meddlesome fools in the world, Dobbins was the
craziest! Wait until he found him! Wait until
he told him what he thought of him! Wait&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But just then Myron realised that waiting was
the one thing he couldn’t afford. The clock had
ticked off two minutes of the precious time remaining
to him and the long hand was moving
past the half-hour already. He studied his predicament.
Joe had, it appeared, used his own
sheets and quilt and, probably, other things as
well, and Myron was as securely fastened down
as Gulliver by the Lilliputians! He could move
each leg about an inch and each arm the same.
By arching his back he could lift his body just
off the bed: something, possibly a sheet, crossed
his chest and was tied fast to the side rails. He
squirmed until he was exhausted, and the only
apparent result was to give himself the fraction
of an inch more freedom. He subsided, panting,
and his anger found room for grudging admiration
of Joe’s work. How that idiot had managed
to swathe and bind him as he had done without
waking him up was both a marvel and a mystery!</p>

<p>“Gee,” muttered Myron, “I knew I was a sound
sleeper, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Words failed him. Presently, despairing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
success, he tried to free his right hand. Something
that felt like a strap&mdash;he discovered afterwards
that it was one of his neckties&mdash;was wound
about the wrist, and his efforts were of no avail.
The other hand was quite as securely tied. Tugging
his feet against similar bonds was equally
unprofitable. When the hands of the clock on the
dresser indicated seventeen minutes to seven he
gave up and tried to find consolation in arranging
the eloquent remarks he meant to deliver
to Joe Dobbins when that offensive youth
returned.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, history was in the making on the
trampled field of battle.</p>

<p>At a few minutes before the half-hour after
six, a large, wide-shouldered youth attired in a
pair of old trousers, a faded brown sweater that
lacked part of one sleeve and a cloth cap of a
violent green-and-brown plaid might have been
seen ambling leisurely across the campus in the
direction of the West Gate. In fact, he was seen,
for from an open window on the front of Leonard
Hall a pyjama-clad boy thrust his head forth and
hailed softly.</p>

<p>“Hi, Joe! Joe Dobbins!” he called.</p>

<p>Joe paused and searched the front of the building
until a spot of pale lavender against the expanse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of sunlit brick supplied the clue. Then:
“Hello, Keith,” he answered. “Can’t you
sleep?”</p>

<p>Leighton Keith chuckled. “Where are you
going?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Just for a stroll,” replied Joe carelessly.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute and I’ll come along.”</p>

<p>Joe shook his head. “Got a date, Keith, with
a guy named Eldredge.”</p>

<p>Keith nodded and waved, but, after Joe had
passed from sight around the corner of the building,
he pursed his lips thoughtfully and stared
out into the early morning world. Gradually a
smile curved his mouth. “Paul Eldredge,” he
murmured. “Guess we’ll look into this.” He
donned a dressing-gown and passed into the corridor
and along it until he reached a window that
overlooked Linden Street. Joe was just sauntering
through the gate, hands in pockets, nonchalance
expressed in every motion. But Keith noted with
satisfaction that he turned to the right into Apple
Street and presently crossed that thoroughfare
and disappeared into the lane that led toward
the abandoned brickyard. Keith whistled expressively
if subduedly and went quickly back to
his room and aroused Harry Cater by the simple
method of pulling the clothes from him. “Katie,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
as he was called, groaned, clutched ineffectually
for the bedding and opened one eye.</p>

<p>“Wake up, Katie,” said Keith. “Joe Dobbins
has a scrap on with Eldredge at the brickyard.
Come on!”</p>

<p>“Howjuno?” muttered Katie.</p>

<p>“He just told me.” That was near enough the
truth, Keith considered. Katie opened the other
eye, stared around the room and slung one foot
over the edge of the bed. “All right,” he said
briskly. “Wait till I get a shower and I’ll be
with you.”</p>

<p>“Shower? Nothing doing!” Keith was piling
rapidly into his clothes. “There isn’t time. This
is something a little bit choice, old man, and we
don’t want to miss it. Get a move on!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>ELDREDGE REJECTS A SUBSTITUTE</small></h2>


<p>Joe made his leisurely way along the lane, his
feet rustling the leaves that littered the grassy
path. There had been a frost during the night
and in shaded places it still glistened. When he
had left the lane and was making his way between
the old tumbledown shed with its piles of crumbling
bricks and one of the clay pits he saw that there
was a skim of ice on the water below him. It was
a morning that induced a fine feeling of well-being,
that made the blood course quickly and
would have put a song on Joe’s lips had he been
able to sing a note. As it was, he whistled instead.</p>

<p>Ahead of him was a smallish shed, perhaps at
one time the office. Some rusted barrows and
pieces of machinery lay about it. As it presented
the only place of concealment in sight, Joe concluded
that it was the place of appointment.
Eldredge, however, had not arrived. Joe made
sure of that by looking on all sides of the building
and peering into the interior through a paneless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
window. So he seated himself in the sunlight
and philosophically waited.</p>

<p>Some ten minutes passed and then he heard
footsteps and presently around the corner appeared
Paul Eldredge and Sam Rogers. Joe
frowned. Eldredge shouldn’t have brought a
second fellow without telling Myron of his intention.
The newcomers stopped in surprise when
they saw Joe, and after an instant Eldredge said:
“Hello! Have you seen&mdash;Is Foster here?”</p>

<p>“Hello,” replied Joe. “Foster? No, he isn’t
coming.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t coming!” exclaimed Eldredge. Then he
laughed. “What do you know about that? What
did I tell you, Sam?”</p>

<p>Rogers nodded. “I know. You said he
wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Fact is,” said Joe, “he can’t.”</p>

<p>“Can’t, eh? I suppose he’s sick,” sneered
Eldredge.</p>

<p>Joe shook his head gently and pulled himself to
his feet. “No, he ain’t sick, he’s&mdash;he’s confined
to his bed.” He chuckled, much to the mystification
of the others. Eldredge scowled.</p>

<p>“What is this, a silly joke?” he demanded peevishly.</p>

<p>“No, oh, no, it ain’t any joke,” answered Joe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
gravely. “It’s this way, Eldredge. Foster’s no
scrapper. Doesn’t know the first thing about it.
Of course you didn’t know that when you arranged
this party. You wanted a nice little fight.
Foster couldn’t give it to you. Why, he doesn’t
know how to even block. You wouldn’t have had
any sport at all. It would have been all over in
a wag of a duck’s tail. I told him that, but he
wouldn’t see it. I said: ‘This guy Eldredge wants
a scrap, kiddo. He doesn’t want to get up at that
time of day just to see you topple over every time
he reaches out. Give him a chance,’ I said. ‘You
stay in bed and I’ll take the job off your hands.’
Course, I’m no professional, Eldredge, but I know
enough to give you a bit of fun. But Foster
wouldn’t see it. Insisted that he had to come
himself.”</p>

<p>“Say, for the love of Mike,” broke in Eldredge,
“are you crazy?”</p>

<p>“Me? No, I don’t believe so,” answered Joe
mildly. “Anyway, I couldn’t get him to look at
it right, and so this morning I just woke up a bit
early and tied him up in bed.” He chuckled.
“I’ll bet he’s spouting blue murder right now!”</p>

<p>“That’s a likely yarn!” sneered Eldredge.
“Tied up in bed! Yes, he is&mdash;not! He got you
to come and tell that story to save his face!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I sort of came to save his face,” answered
Joe genially, “but not just the way you
mean: and he didn’t have anything to do with
it. He’s tied right down to his bed this
minute.”</p>

<p>“If he is,” said Rogers, “he helped do it.”</p>

<p>“No.” Joe shook his head patiently. “He was
asleep. I’d like you guys to believe that. It always
sort of disgruntles me when folks don’t believe
what I tell ’em, and I’m likely to get real
mad.”</p>

<p>Rogers blinked. “Well&mdash;well, then there’s
nothing doing, Paul,” he said very mildly.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing?” echoed Joe in surprise.
“What do you mean, nothing doing? Ain’t I
here? Sure, there’s something doing. Him and
me&mdash;I mean he and I are going to have a real good
time.”</p>

<p>“We are not,” replied Eldredge disgustedly.
“It’s the plainest sort of a frame-up, Sam. I
knew all along Foster didn’t have any sand. I
told you he’d duck.”</p>

<p>“Say, you must have got me wrong,” said Joe
earnestly. “Foster wanted to come, but I
wouldn’t let him. It wasn’t fair to him or you,
kiddo. Don’t you see? He’d have got all messed
up and you’d have been downright disappointed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
That’s why I took it over. You and me are about
of a size and weight and I’ll bet we can have a
right good scrap.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care to fight you,” said Eldredge disdainfully.
“Why should I? I don’t even know
you!”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know you, either,” replied Joe
calmly. “So we’re all-square there, eh? Listen,
Brother: if you’re holding back on my account,
don’t do it. I don’t mind a scrap. Fact is, I’d
be mighty disappointed if I didn’t have it, after
coming away over here like this. And so would
you, of course. You’re like me; get sort of low-spirited
if you don’t have a little set-to now and
then. Ain’t that right?”</p>

<p>Eldredge was viewing Joe in mingled astonishment
and uneasiness. This big, raw-boned chap
didn’t look good to him as an opponent. His
arms were discouragingly long and the shoulders
hinted at a muscular development quite unusual.
Also, there was a quiet gleam in the greenish-grey
eyes that made Eldredge feel a bit creepy along
his spine. He laughed nervously.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a chump,” he begged. “Of course
I’m not going to fight you. I had a row with
Foster, but if you say he doesn’t know how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
fight, why, all right. We’ll call it off. I don’t
want to fight any fellow that’s no match for
me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I told him,” said Joe delightedly.
“I said, ‘That guy’s going to be tickled
to death when I show up instead of you.’”</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Rogers, tugging at his friend’s
sleeve.</p>

<p>“Of course,” went on Eldredge, “if Foster
wants to go on with it later, I’m ready for him,
but&mdash;but as far as I’m concerned I’m willing to
call quits.”</p>

<p>“Atta boy!” said Joe approvingly. “Well, now
that’s settled and you and me can go ahead.”
Joe began to peel off his sweater. Eldredge
frowned and shot an anxious look at Rogers.</p>

<p>“I’ve told you I wouldn’t fight you,” he said,
“and I won’t.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded Joe. “Ain’t I good
enough for you? Trying to insult me, eh?” he
scowled darkly. “Is that it?”</p>

<p>“Of course not! I haven’t any row with you.
Besides, it’s nearly time for chapel and I don’t
intend to get in wrong at the Office just to please
you!”</p>

<p>“That don’t go, kiddo. I’ve offered to fight you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and you’ve insulted me by refusing. That’s
enough. Now you pull that coat off and stand up
here.”</p>

<p>“You’re crazy! I won’t be forced into a fight
like this. You haven’t any right to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Joe gave a howl. “Haven’t any rights, haven’t
I? We’ll see. No guy can tell me I haven’t any
rights and not fight! Now then, come on!”</p>

<p>“I said you hadn’t any right to make me fight,”
protested Eldredge. “You’re just&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I heard you!” answered Joe ominously.
“Don’t repeat it! It’s something no guy can say
to me and not answer for! By jiminy, you’ve got
a cheek! No rights, eh? Ain’t I a free-born
American citizen?” Joe slung his sweater aside,
slipped his suspenders down and knotted them
about his waist and advanced on the embarrassed
enemy. “What about the Declaration of Independence?”
he demanded wrathfully.</p>

<p>“You know well enough what I mean,” declared
Eldredge somewhat shrilly. “I refuse to fight
you! I haven’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Insulted again!” roared Joe fearsomely.
“Put up your fists!”</p>

<p>Eldredge was backing away toward the corner
of the shed, Rogers a good two yards in the lead.
“I won’t! I’ve told you! You can’t bully me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
into fighting when&mdash;when I’ve got nothing to fight
about!”</p>

<p>“Call me a bully now, do you?” growled Joe in
ominous calm. He cast an outraged look to the
heavens. “Brother, you’ve gone the limit. Look
out for yourself!” He swung his right arm up
and out. The blow, had it connected, would have
lifted Eldredge off his feet and deposited him
yards away. But it was woefully short, suggesting
that Joe was a poor judge of distance. Nevertheless
it so alarmed Eldredge that he trod on his
friend’s toes in his hurried retreat, and a wail
of pain and protest arose from Rogers, a wail
that, mingling with peals of laughter that
seemed to come from overhead, made a weird
confusion of sound. The group on the ground
abruptly paused in their careers and bewilderedly
searched the sky for that Jovian
laughter. They hadn’t far to seek. Atop the shed
roof, their convulsed countenances showing above
the peak, were stretched Leighton Keith and
Harry Cater.</p>

<p>Joe, after a surprised recognition, grinned and
unknotted his suspenders. Eldredge grew red
where he had been inclined to pallor and looked
unutterably foolish. Rogers smiled in a sickly
fashion and dug embarrassed hands into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
pockets. On the roof the unsuspected guests conquered
their laughter, and Keith said to Joe:
“Sorry if we&mdash;spoiled your&mdash;fun&mdash;Dobbins, but
we couldn’t&mdash;hold in any longer!”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t know I was amusing an audience,”
replied Joe, “but it don’t matter.” He
picked up his sweater as Keith and Cater slid
to the edge and dropped over. “Guess we’ll have
to postpone this, Eldredge,” he continued. “Too
many folks around, eh? I’ll fix another date with
you.”</p>

<p>Katie chuckled. “I fancy Eldredge is satisfied,”
he said. “Eh, Paul?”</p>

<p>Eldredge glowered. “I didn’t have any
quarrel with him,” he muttered. “He&mdash;he’s
crazy!”</p>

<p>Katie and Keith seemed to find this most amusing,
but after a moment of laughter Keith recovered
his gravity and said: “I guess you can
be trusted to keep this business quiet, Eldredge.
How about you, Rogers?” Rogers nodded, his
countenance expressing a relief equal to
Eldredge’s. “Good. I know Dobbins won’t talk,
and neither will we. So there’s no reason why the
thing should get out. In a way, it’s a pity to keep
it to ourselves, for the fellows would certainly
enjoy it, but some jokes are too good to be told.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
If you want to lead a happy life hereafter,
Eldredge, you’d better keep mum! And, by the
way, if I ever hear of you scrapping any more
I’ll be tempted to tell what happened this morning.
You’re much too blood-thirsty, Eldredge,
you really are. Restrain yourself, my boy, restrain
yourself.” Eldredge muttered something
as he moved away. “What was that?” asked Keith
sharply. “Did I hear a bad word?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Eldredge aggrievedly, “you
didn’t. I said, ‘All right.’”</p>

<p>“Hm: I’ll try to believe you: but you’d better
beat it before I begin to have doubts!”</p>

<p>Rogers had already melted around the corner
of the shed and Eldredge, pausing only long
enough to send a last vindictive glance at Joe,
followed. Alone, the three looked at each other
in amused silence. Then Katie helped Joe into
his sweater and together they turned toward
school. It was only when the forms of Eldredge
and Rogers were seen hurrying into the lane that
Keith’s risibilities again got the better of him
and he began to chuckle. Whereupon Joe and
Katie joined.</p>

<p>It was getting dangerously close to chapel time
when Myron, smouldering with anger, heard the
study door open and the heavy tread of Joe approaching.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
When the latter appeared Myron was
more than ready for him.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;” he stammered, “you big&mdash;big&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>It was maddening! His nicely arranged flow
of invective, his long list of insulting adjectives
were gone! He couldn’t get his tongue around a
single word that satisfied his requirements. All
he could do was glare and sputter and strain at
his bonds. And Joe stood at the foot of the bed
and viewed him mildly and patiently.</p>

<p>“You let me loose!” cried Myron. “You untie
me this minute! You’ll see what’ll happen to
you, you big&mdash;big <em>boob</em>!” Myron groaned at the
utter inadequacy of that appellation and gave up
the attempt to do justice to his feelings. Joe
blinked.</p>

<p>“Got to have your promise not to start any
ructions first,” he announced. “It’s pretty near
chapel time, Foster, and if you try scrapping with
me you’ll be late. So’ll I. Better dress quietly
and let me explain things.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to punch your ugly face!” fumed
Myron. “I don’t care a hang who’s late to what!
You can’t spring your silly tricks on me like this,
Dobbins! You can’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then I’ll have to let you stay where you are,”
said Joe regretfully.</p>

<p><a href="#image02">“You let me up!”</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 444px;">
<a id="image02" name="image02"><img src="images/image02.jpg" width="444" height="600"

     title="“You let me up!”" /></a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_143">“<i>You let me up!</i>”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Promise not to start anything?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t get up. You stay right here
until I tell you all about it.” Joe seated himself
at the foot of the bed and glanced at the clock
on the chiffonier. “You see, Foster, it was like
this.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to hear it! I want to get up!”</p>

<p>“Then give me your word to behave.”</p>

<p>Myron studied Joe’s unperturbed face, hesitated
and gave in. “All right,” he growled.
“But I’ll&mdash;I’ll get even with you yet.”</p>

<p>“Sure! Now then we’ll do some hustling.”
For two minutes Joe was very busy with knots.
“Hope these things didn’t hurt,” he said apologetically.
“I tried to fix ’em so you’d be comfortable.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, I’m sure,” said Myron in deep sarcasm.
“I can’t tell you how much I appreciate
your thoughtfulness!”</p>

<p>Joe grinned. “Well, anyway, I didn’t wake you
up, kiddo, did I? Didn’t do you out of any sleep,
eh? Say, the Sleeping Quince, or whatever the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
guy in the fairy story was called, hasn’t a thing
on you, Foster. You’re the soundest little slumberer
that ever pounded an ear! There you are.
Now, then, slip into some duds and let’s beat it.
We’ve just got time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>MYRON CHANGES HIS MIND</small></h2>


<p>The fact that the incident would never become
known and make him look ridiculous made it much
easier for Myron to forgive Joe for the trick.
And the latter’s account of the meeting with
Eldredge&mdash;Myron got it piecemeal before and
after chapel&mdash;was so funny that he had to smile
more than once in spite of his determination to
be haughty and unrelenting. In the end he said
grudgingly: “We-ell, I suppose you meant it all
right, Dobbins, but it wasn’t fair. Now was it?”
And Dobbins obligingly shook his head very
soberly and allowed that it wasn’t. In such fashion
amity was restored and peace prevailed again.</p>

<p>That afternoon, encountering Harry Cater on
the field before practice, Myron regarded that
youth keenly, looking for signs of amusement and
ready to resent them. But Katie’s countenance
suggested no secret diversion. Perhaps he regarded
Myron with just a fraction more interest
than usual, but it was quite respectful interest.
There was a big cut in the football candidates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
that afternoon and when Coach Driscoll had
sheathed his knife again their number had been
reduced to sixty-odd. Myron survived, as he deserved
to, and so, naturally, did Joe. Joe was already
being talked about and more than once
had heard his playing discussed and praised.
Good linemen are always in demand, and this year,
at Parkinson, they were more than ever welcome,
for graduation had deprived the eleven of several
stars since last fall.</p>

<p>The squads were reduced to four now, and
Myron had slipped into a half-back position on the
third. There was nothing certain about that position.
Some days he went into practice at right
half and some days at left, and sometimes he sat
on the bench most of the time when scrimmaging
began. He was rather resentful because his work
wasn’t getting recognition. As a matter of fact,
however, he was showing up no more cleverly than
half a dozen other candidates for the positions.
He handled the ball well, remembered signals, ran
hard and fast, dodged fairly and caught punts
nicely. So did Meldrum, Brown, Brounker,
Vance, Robbins and one or two more. Myron’s
mistake was in supposing that, because none
praised him, his work wasn’t appreciated. He
had an idea that neither coach nor captain really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
knew of his existence, when, as a matter of fact,
he was more than once under discussion during
the nightly conferences in Mr. Driscoll’s quarters.</p>

<p>“Promising,” was the coach’s comment one evening
when the subject of half-backs was before the
meeting. “Plays a nice, clean-cut game. Lacks
judgment, though.”</p>

<p>“Handles punts well,” said Captain Mellen.
“Made a corking catch yesterday. Remember
when Kearns punted down to the twenty yards?
That was a peach of a punt, by the way: all of
fifty, wasn’t it, Ken?”</p>

<p>“Forty-six,” answered Farnsworth.</p>

<p>“That all? Anyway, this Foster chap made a
heady catch, with two ends almost on him and the
ball nearly over his head. He’ll round out nicely
for next year, I guess.”</p>

<p>It was Myron’s misfortune that he had elected
to try for a half-back position at a time when
there was much excellent half-back material on
hand. Probably he didn’t realise the fact, for he
began to get more disgruntled by the end of that
week and secretly accused Mr. Driscoll and Jud
Mellen of “playing favourites.” Not altogether
secretly, either, for he once aired his suspicions
for Joe’s benefit. “There’s no chance for a chap
here unless he’s known,” he said bitterly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
“Maybe if I stay here two or three years longer
Driscoll will discover that I’m alive. As it is,
if it wasn’t for Farnsworth keeping tabs on the
fellows, I could cut practice and no one would
ever know it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” answered Joe judicially.
“It looks to me like you were getting the same
treatment the rest of ’em are getting. Some day
you’ll show ’em what you can do and they’ll wake
up. I guess your trouble is that you’re bucking
against a lot of good backs. Take fellows like
Brown and Meldrum and Vance, now. They’re
<em>good</em>. You’ve got to hand it to them, kiddo. Corking
halves, all of them. Hard to beat. But that
don’t mean that you can’t beat ’em. Buckle down
and go hard, Foster. The season’s young yet.”</p>

<p>“I’m not anxious enough,” answered Myron,
“to kill myself. I dare say I can get along without
playing on the team this year. And next year
I’ll go somewhere where they give a fellow a fair
chance, by George!”</p>

<p>“Well, if that’s your idea you won’t get far,”
said Joe drily. “If you don’t care yourself no
one’s going to care for you. A guy’s got to hustle
and be in earnest to get anywhere in this world.
I know that!”</p>

<p>“You fell into it pretty soft,” answered Myron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
with a laugh that sounded none too agreeable.
“There’s nothing like getting in with the right
crowd, eh?”</p>

<p>Joe regarded him with a frown, started to
speak, thought better of it and merely grunted.
But after a moment he said dispassionately:
“Don’t be a sore-head, Foster. It don’t get you
anything but hard looks.”</p>

<p>“I’m no sore-head,” laughed the other carelessly.
“Gee, it doesn’t mean anything in my
young life to play with their old football team.
I’ve captained a better team than this school will
ever turn out!”</p>

<p>“If I was you,” replied Joe earnestly, “I’d forget
about being captain of that team, kiddo, and
see if I couldn’t make a first-class private of myself.”</p>

<p>Myron flushed. “It’s all well enough for you to&mdash;to
give advice and say cute things, Dobbins, but
you’ve made yourself solid with the fellows who
have the say in football matters and you’re pretty
sure of a place. I haven’t, and I don’t intend to.
If Mellen and Cater and some of those fellows
think I’m going to kow-tow to them, they’re mightily
mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Meaning I got my chance by&mdash;what do you
call it?&mdash;cultivating those fellows?” asked Joe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
“You made that crack before and I let it pass,
Foster, but it don’t go this time. If I’m playing
on the second squad it’s because I got out there
and worked like a horse, and you know it,
Brother!”</p>

<p>Myron dropped his eyes and a long moment of
silence followed. Then he said: “I was a rotter,
Dobbins. I’m sorry. I guess I am a sore-head,
like you said. I guess&mdash;I guess I’ll just quit and
have done with it.”</p>

<p>Joe laughed. “All right, kiddo! We’ll start
fresh. But why don’t you cut out the grouching
and just play the game? What’s it to you if you
don’t get into the lime-light? Ain’t it something
to do what you’re put at and do it well? Say,
there’s about sixty guys out there every afternoon,
ain’t there? Well, how many of them do
you suppose will get places on the first team?
Not more than twenty-six, probably. And about
twenty more will go into the scrub team. And
the others will beat it and try again next year,
likely. Every one can’t be a hero, Foster. Some
of us have got to lug water!”</p>

<p>“There’s no fun in lugging water, though,”
Myron objected.</p>

<p>“Who says so? There’s fun in doing anything
if you set out to like it, kiddo. The guys who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
miss the fun are those who get it into their heads
that the job isn’t good enough for ’em, or that
some one’s imposing on ’em. What sort of a
fellow would Merriman be if he got that dope
to working in his bean? He’s lugging water, all
right, believe me! Living on a couple of dollars
a week and working about sixteen hours a day!
But he gets fun out of it, don’t he? He’s about
the happiest guy around these parts, ain’t he?
Mind you, Foster, I ain’t saying that a fellow’s
got to be <em>satisfied</em> with just lugging water. He
oughtn’t to be. He ought to be thinking about the
time when he can chuck the pail and do something
better. But while he is lugging water he wants to
do it well and whistle at it!”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Myron, good temper restored,
“I’ll keep on with the pail a while longer.
Say, Dobbins, you ought to prepare for the ministry
or the lecture platform. You’re going to waste
yourself shovelling spruce gum!”</p>

<p>Joe smiled. “I’m not going to shovel spruce
gum, kiddo. I’m going to be a lawyer. How’s
that hit you?”</p>

<p>“If I’m ever arrested for murder I’ll certainly
send for you!” answered Myron emphatically.</p>

<p>Two days later Myron received notice that his
overdue furniture had arrived. For some reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
he was not nearly so keen about it as he had been
a week or more ago. And when, accompanied by
Joe&mdash;he had felt the need of a practical mind in
the matter of getting the things off the car and
up to the dormitory and had begged Joe’s assistance&mdash;he
saw how many pieces of furniture
there were he was, to use his own word, flabbergasted.
For his part, Joe just stared and blinked.
Every piece was carefully and enormously crated,
and the staring address on each was a horrible
challenge. For the things were much larger than
he remembered them and when he thought of the
limited area of Number 17 Sohmer he gasped.
The services of the Warne Warehouse Company
had been called on, and three husky men were soon
emptying the car while Myron and Joe sat on a
baggage truck and looked on. Myron felt somewhat
apologetic and shot occasional inquiring
glances at his companion. But Joe was silent and
seemingly unmoved after the first survey. Myron
ventured at last:</p>

<p>“I don’t see where all the stuff is going, do
you?”</p>

<p>Joe shook his head. “No, I don’t. Maybe
they’ll let you put about half of it in the corridor.”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing to joke about,” Myron grumbled.
“We won’t be able to move without barking our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
shins. I’d like to know how big mother thinks
those rooms are!”</p>

<p>“I’m not worrying about my shins,” said Joe
placidly, adding when Myron looked a question:
“I won’t be there, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the other. Silence again prevailed.
The trucks trundled from box-car to platform and
a nearby engine let off steam with disconcerting
suddenness. Finally: “I shouldn’t think you’d
want to live in that room if it’s like you say it is,”
observed Myron. “Only one window and&mdash;and
all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it ain’t so worse. Merriman wants me to
go over and take half his place, but that part of
town’s pretty fierce.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! Why, that’s an awful hole he’s
in!”</p>

<p>“Well, with something more in it, it wouldn’t
be bad.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see&mdash;&mdash;” Myron paused and was busy
for a moment detaching a splinter from beside
him. “I don’t see,” he continued, “why you want
to move anyhow.”</p>

<p>Joe turned slowly and observed him in mild
surprise. “Well, considering that you invited me
to,” he answered, “that’s a funny crack to make.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they wouldn’t let me have the rooms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
by myself, anyhow,” said Myron. “And I’d
rather have you with me than&mdash;than some fellow
I didn’t know at all.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, but I guess I’d better light out. I’m
sort of backwoodsy for you, Foster. Maybe the
next guy will be more your style, see? Besides&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Besides what?” demanded Myron with a
frown.</p>

<p>Joe chuckled and nodded toward the furniture.
“I couldn’t live up to that,” he said.</p>

<p>Myron’s gaze followed his companion’s and he
viewed the crated monstrosities distastefully. “I
don’t see why you need to keep rubbing it in
about my&mdash;my ‘style,’” he said crossly. “Just
because I have more than two suits of clothes you
needn’t always try to make out that I’m a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” answered Joe calmly. “Besides,
I’ve got four suits myself now: and an extra pair
of trousers!”</p>

<p>“Then&mdash;then it’s just that stuff?” asked
Myron, waving toward the furniture.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. Maybe. You see, kiddo&mdash;I
mean Foster&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up,” muttered Myron.</p>

<p>“You see, I’ve been used to simple things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
The old man and me&mdash;I&mdash;me&mdash;whatever it is&mdash;lived
pretty plain for a long time. Lately we’ve
stayed in a hotel in Portland most of the time.
I ain’t used to chiffoniers and enamelled tables
and all those gimcracks. I’d feel sort of&mdash;of low
in my mind if I had to live in a place all dolled
up with ribbons and lace and mirrors and things.”</p>

<p>“There aren’t any ribbons and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, you get my idea,” continued Joe untroubledly.
“Me, I sort of feel freer and more
contented in a log-cabin. I suppose it’s all what
you’re used to, eh?”</p>

<p>Myron made no reply for a minute. They were
loading the big moving-van now and he watched
them morosely. He half wished they’d drop that
grey-enamelled bookcase over the side. At last
he said desperately: “Look here, Joe! If I dump
all that truck into the warehouse will you stay?”</p>

<p>It was the first time he had ever called Joe by
his first name and that youth looked almost
startled. “Why&mdash;why, you don’t want to do
that!” he stammered.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” replied Myron doggedly. “That’s
just what I do want. It was a mistake, sending it.
I sort of felt so when mother suggested it, but she
set her heart on it, you know: thought I’d be
more comfortable and all if I had my own things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
But they’d look awfully silly, all those light grey
tables and chairs and bookcases, and I don’t want
them there. So&mdash;so I’m going to let these folks
store them until spring. There’s no use hurting
mother’s feelings, and I’ll just let her think that
I’m using them; unless she asks me. When
spring comes I’ll ship them back. And you’ll stay
where you are, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Gosh! Say, this is so sudden, kiddo! And it
sure seems an awful shame to hide all those corking
things. But&mdash;why, if you really don’t want
them and&mdash;and you don’t mind me being sort of
rough and&mdash;and all that, I’ll stick around.”</p>

<p>“Honest, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Sure, kiddo!”</p>

<p>Myron drew a long breath of relief and turned
to the man in charge of the job. “I’ve changed
my mind,” he said. “Take those things to the
warehouse, will you? And tell them I’ll be around
tomorrow and fix things up.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>“CHAS”</small></h2>


<p>Only one thing troubled Joe, which was that he
couldn’t have Zephaniah with him. Faculty
strongly disapproved of dogs, even very young
and very small dogs, in the dormitories. So he
made arrangements with a good-hearted stableman
to look after the puppy and himself rigged
up a home for it in an unused stall behind a litter
of brooms and old harness and buckets. Puppy
biscuit, which Merriman sternly decreed was to
be its only food, was laid in lavishly, a china drinking
bowl was supplied and Zephaniah, very unhappy
at parting from his brothers and sisters
and mother, was duly <em>installed</em>. The pun is not
mine, but Myron’s. Joe visited the stable at least
once a day and was to be seen stalking along the
streets accompanied by a silly, frisking little atom
at the end of a magnificent leather leash. Once
away from the busy thoroughfares, the puppy
was set free and had a glorious time. Frequently
Myron went along on these excursions and the two
boys often laughed themselves sick over the ridiculous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
antics of Zephaniah Q. Dobbins. Several
times Merriman also joined them and took along
Tess and her two remaining offspring, and at
such times life was chock full of excitement and
merriment. The weather was wonderful that
autumn and those strolls about the outskirts of
the town were events that remained in Myron’s
memory long afterwards. They led to an ever-increasing
intimacy between the three boys and
Myron began to find existence at Parkinson really
enjoyable. No one could fail to like Joe Dobbins
or to admire his big-heartedness and sturdy
honesty of purpose and deed, and Myron least of
all. He saw now the kindness that had underlaid
the indignity Joe had practised on him when he
had been forcibly kept from meeting Paul
Eldredge, and was grateful. He saw many other
thoughtful and kindly acts as well. Joe’s rough
ways, or ways that had seemed rough at first, were
now only things to smile at. Myron was learning
that there were many things less to be desired in
a friend and room-mate than uncouthness. New
clothes, too, had made a difference in Joe. Under
Myron’s guiding hand he had purchased two plain
but well-fitting suits&mdash;as well as the extra pair of
trousers that Myron had advised and that Joe was
now so proud of&mdash;and, in a way, he was living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
up to those suits. He had been good-naturedly
guyed by many of his friends and acquaintances,
of which he had dozens a week after the beginning
of school, for the change wrought in his appearance
had been well-nigh startling, but he hadn’t
minded a bit: it took more than that to upset
Joe’s equanimity. It was about the time that he
first appeared in classroom in his new clothes
that some fellow fell on the quite obvious nickname
of “Whoa,” to which Joe was already accustomed,
and from that time on he was “Whoa”
Dobbins to the whole school. Only Myron and
Andrew Merriman stuck to “Joe.”</p>

<p>Merriman required more knowing than Joe Dobbins.
Although Myron had liked him at first acquaintance
and grew to like him more as time
went on, he never felt that he knew him as
thoroughly as he knew the other. “Merry
Andrew” at first meeting seemed perfectly understandable.
At the second meeting you realised
that most of him was below the surface. At subsequent
meetings you despaired of ever knowing
him thoroughly. He was the happiest, cheerfulest
fellow Myron had ever encountered, and no
one would have suspected that there was such a
thing as a care in his life. And perhaps there
weren’t many, either, for a care doesn’t become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
a care until you let it, and Merriman’s policy was
not to let it. Of friends, at least close friends,
beyond Joe and Andrew, Myron had none so far.
He knew various fellows, most of them football
chaps, but only casually. He didn’t make friends
easily. It is only fair to acknowledge that there
was something in Myron’s attitude, although he
didn’t realise it, that warned fellows away. Popularity
such as Joe might attain would never fall
to his share.</p>

<p>So a fortnight passed and Parkinson played her
second football game and began to find her stride.
Cumner High School proved less of an adversary
than expected and went down to defeat, 12 to 0.
Myron didn’t get into action: didn’t expect to,
for that matter: and neither did Joe. Joe, however,
expected to, and was a little disappointed
and decidedly restive while he and Myron watched
from the bench. Inaction didn’t suit Joe a bit.
Garrison, who had played the position last season
on the scrub eleven, stayed in at right guard until
the last quarter and then Mills, a recent discovery
of Coach Driscoll’s, was given a chance.
Mills, a big, yellow-haired infant of seventeen,
proved willing and hard-working, but he was
woefully inexperienced, and only the fact that
Cumner had already shot her bolt and was playing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
a strictly defensive game kept him in until the
final whistle.</p>

<p>Joe’s hero on the team was Leighton Keith, who
played right tackle. Joe expatiated for whole
minutes at a time on Keith’s work and rather
bored Myron. “Honest, Joe,” he protested, “I
think he plays perfectly good ball and all that, but
I don’t see where he has anything on Mellen, or
even Flay.”</p>

<p>Joe shook his head. “You aren’t watching him,
Myron. You’ve got to know the position, too.
I’ve played tackle, kiddo, and I know what a guy’s
up against. I’ll tell you about Keith and Mellen.
Mellen’s a fair, average tackle, a heap better on
attack than defence, I guess, but Keith’s more
than that. He&mdash;look here, it’s like this. Know
those dollar ‘turnips’? Well, they keep right
good time, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Some of them,” agreed Myron.</p>

<p>“Most of them, Brother. Well, Mellen’s like a
dollar watch. Looks good outside and works all
right inside. Dependable and all that. All right!
Now did you ever cast your eye over a nice
hundred and fifty dollar watch all dotted over inside
with jewels and all glisteny with little wheels
and dudads? Sure! That’s Keith. He works
just like the innards of that watch, kiddo. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
move’s exact. He never misses a tick. He’s
smooth-running and guaranteed. He&mdash;he’s an
artist! I’d just as lief see Keith play tackle as
see old Josh Reynolds paint one of his million-dollar
portraits.”</p>

<p>“Reynolds is dead,” laughed Myron.</p>

<p>“All the more reason then,” replied Joe calmly.
“Keith isn’t!”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Myron, “you cheer for Keith.
To my mind the best player in that brown bunch
is Cater.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, he’s good, too,” owned Joe. “I call
him a nice little quarter. Nice fellow, too, Cater.
So’s Steve Kearns. Know him?”</p>

<p>“Playing full-back? No, only to nod to. I
don’t think he’s as good a full-back as Williams,
though.”</p>

<p>“Both of them will stand improving,” said Joe
drily. “Gee, I wish Driscoll would let me in on
this!”</p>

<p>But, as has been said, he didn’t, and when the
game was over Joe and Myron trotted back to the
gymnasium with a host of others equally unfortunate.
After showers and a return to citizen’s
clothing they took Zephaniah Q. Dobbins for a
walk. Or, it would be more exact to say, a romp.</p>

<p>The Latin coaching ended the last of the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
week, by which time Andrew Merriman declared
Myron up with the class. Myron wasn’t so certain
of it and would have continued the tutoring if
Andrew hadn’t refused. “You’re discharged,”
said Andrew. “You know about as much as
Old Addie himself now, and a lot more than I.
All you have got to do is study.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?” asked Myron ironically. “It
isn’t anything if you say it quick, is it?”</p>

<p>But Andrew proved right about it, and Myron
found that as much work applied to Latin as to
other studies kept him on good terms with Old
Addie.</p>

<p>There was one thorn in Myron’s side at this
time, and its name was Charles Cummins. Cummins
was a riddle to Myron. Ever since the time
he had spent that unpleasant half-hour in Cummins’
awkward squad the freckle-faced, shock-haired
giant had never let an opportunity pass to
accost him. There was no harm in that, of course;
the trouble was that Cummins always made himself
so disagreeable! It seemed to Myron that the
chap deliberately sought him out in order to rile
him. And it wasn’t so much what Cummins said
as the way he said it. It got so that Myron only
had to see the other approaching to feel huffy.
Long before Cummins got within speaking distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Myron had his back up, and Cummins,
knowing it, seemed to take delight in it.</p>

<p>Cummins was generally known as “Chas,”
from his habit of signing himself “Chas. L. Cummins.”
He declared that Charles was far too
long to spell out. He played left guard and
played it well if erratically. In a way, he was
difficult to get along with, for he considered himself
a law unto himself, and it was no unusual
thing for him to veto a coach’s instructions, which,
up to a certain point, the coach stood for. The
others were at outs with him half the time, but
liked him through all. Oddly enough, even the
timidest youngster he ever bullied and brow-beat
in practice was strong for him afterwards. It was
no secret that he was holding his position on the
first team by little more than an eyelash, for
Brodhead was hot on his trail and Coach Driscoll
had put up with more of Cummins’ calm insurrection
than was agreeable to him. In appearance
“Chas” was a broad, heavily-built giant
with much red-brown hair that never was known
to lie straight, eyes that nearly matched the hair
and a round, freckled face that was seldom neutral.
It was either scowling savagely or grinning
broadly. For his part, Myron preferred Cummins’
scowls to his smiles, for the smiles generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
held mischief. Usually the two encountered
each other only on the playfield in the afternoon,
but one morning a few days after the Cumner
game Myron, walking back to the room after a
chemistry class, sighted Cummins coming out of
Goss Hall.</p>

<p>“Gee, there’s that pest!” he muttered, and,
contrary to school regulations, started on a short
cut across the grass in the hope of avoiding him.
But it was not to be. Cummins had sighted his
prey.</p>

<p>“O Foster!” he called.</p>

<p>Myron nodded and kept on.</p>

<p>“Tarry, I prithee! I wouldst a word with thee,
fair youth!”</p>

<p>“Go to thunder!” murmured Myron. But Cummins
headed him off without difficulty.</p>

<p>“S’pose you know,” he said, “that we can both
be shot at sunrise for walking cross-lots like this.
Where do you room?”</p>

<p>“Sohmer,” answered Myron briefly.</p>

<p>“Ho, with the swells, eh? Lead on, Reginald!
I would visit thy fair abode in yon palace!”</p>

<p>“Not receiving today, thanks,” said Myron.
“I’ve got some work to do.”</p>

<p>“Work? Didn’t suppose you silk-stocking
bunch in Sohmer ever had to work! Thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
you had slaves to do that sort of thing. How
little one half the school knows how t’other half
lives! To think of you soiling your lily-white
hands and getting calloused with labour! What
sort of work are you going to do? Clip coupons?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up!” exploded Myron. “I’m sick
to death of your chatter! And I’m sick of being
guyed all the time, too! Lay off, can’t you?”</p>

<p>To his surprise, “Chas” chuckled and thumped
him on the back. “A-a-ay!” he applauded.
“That’s the stuff, old chap! I was beginning to
think you didn’t have any pep in you. There’s
always hope for a fellow who can get mad!”</p>

<p>“That isn’t hard when you’re around,” answered
Myron, unappeased. “Don’t bang me on
the back, either. I don’t like it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Chas, sobering. “I’ll
behave. Mind if I come up for a few minutes?”</p>

<p>Myron looked at him suspiciously, but for once
Cummins was neither scowling nor grinning. “I
guess not,” he answered ungraciously.</p>

<p>“Fine! But don’t embarrass me with your
welcome, old chap,” chuckled Chas as they
mounted the steps. “Some dive this, isn’t it?
Don’t believe I ever hoped to get in here.” Joe
was not in and when Chas had looked around the
study&mdash;a trifle disappointedly, Myron thought&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
seen the view from the window he seated himself
on the window-seat, took one knee into his
hands and viewed his host reflectively. Myron, at
the table, fussed with his books and fumed inwardly
and wished Cummins would get out. Finally
the latter said: “Foster, you and I ought
to be great pals.”</p>

<p>Myron looked every bit of the astonishment he
felt, and his guest chuckled again. “Because
we’re as unlike as three peas, and the only things
that can be more unlike than three peas is four
peas. You’ve got coin and I’m the poor but
proud scion of a fine old chap who made his living
laying bricks. You’re a swell and I’m a&mdash;well,
I’m not. You’re a sort of touch-me-not and I’d
make friends with any one. Probably we don’t
think alike on any two subjects under the sun.
So we ought to hit it off great. Get the idea?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I don’t,” owned the other, interested
and puzzled.</p>

<p>“It’s the old law of the attraction of opposites,
or whatever it’s called. Now I took a shine to you
right off”&mdash;Myron sniffed, but Chas only smiled
and went on&mdash;“Oh, I don’t always hug a chap I
take a fancy to. That’s not my way. I try ’em
out first. I tried you out, Foster, old chap.”</p>

<p>“Did you? Well, much obliged, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’d rather I minded my own business, you
mean? That’s what I like about you, Foster,
that stand-offishness. I like the way you sort of
turn your nose up and look haughty. You see,
I’m not like that. If a stranger says ‘Howdy’
to me I either say ‘Glad to know you’ or I biff
him one and pass on. I couldn’t freeze him with
a glance as you can to save my precious life.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know I was as bad as that,” said
Myron, a trifle uncomfortable. “I don’t think I
mean to be.”</p>

<p>“Course you don’t. That’s the beauty of it.
It comes natural to you, just like liking artichokes
and olives. I’ll bet you anything you were eating
olives when you were four, and I haven’t got to
really like the pesky things yet!”</p>

<p>“You talk a lot of nonsense,” said Myron, smiling
in spite of himself. “Just what are you getting
at?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not after a loan, anyway,” laughed
Chas. “I was telling you that I tried you out.
So I did. ‘He looks like he was a nice sort under
the shell,’ says I to me. ‘A terrapin isn’t awfully
jolly and friendly when he sticks his head out at
you and hisses, but they tell me that when you
get under the shell he’s mighty good eating.’ So,
thinks I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“The idea being that I’ve got to be dead to be
nice?” asked Myron drily.</p>

<p>“No, not a bit. The&mdash;the simile was unfortunate.
No, but I thought I’d get a peek under the
shell and see what you were really like. So I set
out to make you mad. If a fellow can’t get mad
he’s no good. Anyway, he’s no good to me. And
he’s no good for football. I was just about giving
you up, old chap. You frowned and grumbled and
sputtered once or twice and looked haughty as
anything, but you wouldn’t get your dander up.
Not until today.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Myron, “now that I have got mad,
what’s the big idea?”</p>

<p>“Why, now we can be pals,” answered Chas
unhesitatingly. “How does that strike you?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why, I don’t know!” Myron faltered.
“It sounds like some sort of a silly joke to me,
Cummins.”</p>

<p>“No joke at all.” Chas unclasped his hands
and leaned back, his big, freckled face wreathed in
smiles. “No hurry, though. Think it over. Anyway,
there’s something more important just now.
I’ve watched you on the field, Foster, ever since
they dumped you on me that day. I’ve seen you
play and I can tell you what I think of you, if
you like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>It’s human to like flattery in moderation, and
so Myron said “Go ahead,” and prepared to look
modest.</p>

<p>“I think you’re rotten,” said Chas.</p>

<p>“Wh-what?” gasped Myron.</p>

<p>“Rotten, with a large capital R, Foster.”</p>

<p>“Thanks!”</p>

<p>“Don’t get huffy, old chap. I don’t say you
can’t play good football. I think you can. But
you’re not doing it now. If I didn’t think you
could play the game according to the Old Masters
I wouldn’t be talking about it to you. You play
like a fellow who doesn’t care. You don’t try hard
enough. You don’t deliver the goods. You’re
soldiering. Ever see a man laying a shingle roof?
Well, he could do the whole thing in a day, maybe,
if he worked hard. But he belongs to the union
and the union won’t let him lay more than just
so many shingles. So he has to slow down. That’s
like you. Say, what union do you belong to?”</p>

<p>“I guess the trouble is that I <em>don’t</em> belong,”
said Myron. “I’m an outsider, and so I don’t
get a chance.”</p>

<p>“Tell that to the Marines! Look here, old chap,
you can make a real football player of yourself
if you want to. I’ve watched you and I know.
I’ve seen what you could have done lots of times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
when you didn’t do it. Now, just what is the
row?”</p>

<p>So Myron told him his version of it and Chas
listened silently and even sympathetically. But
at the end he shook his head. “You’re all wrong,
Foster,” he said. “I’ve been here two years now
and I know how things go. The trouble with you,
I guess, is that you came here with the idea that
folks were going to fall all over themselves to
shake hands with you and pull you into the football
team. Isn’t that pretty near so?”</p>

<p>It was, and Myron for the first time realised it,
but he couldn’t quite get himself to acknowledge
it to Cummins. He tried to look hurt and made no
answer.</p>

<p>“Sure!” said Chas. “And when the coach and
the captain didn’t give a dinner in your honour
and ask you to accept a place on the team and give
them the benefit of your advice as to running
same you got peeved. That’s just what I’d have
done if I’d been you, you see, so I know. If it was
me I’d have either gone to the coach and made a
big kick and told him how good I was or else I’d
have gone out and played so hard that they’d
have either had to take me on or chuck me to
save the lives of the others! But you, being
Haughty Harold, just froze them with a glance&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
same they didn’t happen to see&mdash;and went
your way. And it’s a rotten way, too. Because it
won’t get you anywhere. Driscoll won’t fall for
you until you show something and you won’t show
anything until Driscoll pats you on the back. Say,
I’m talking a whole lot! What time is it? And
you’ve got some digging to do! I’ll beat it. Think
over my words of wisdom, Foster, and drop
around tonight and hear more. I’ve got a plan,
old chap. I’m in 16 Goss; first floor, on the right.
Bye-bye!”</p>

<p>And before Myron could agree or refuse the
invitation Cummins had hurried to the door and
was clattering downstairs. Myron went to the
window and, in somewhat of a daze, watched Cummins
emerge below and disappear under the trees.
Then he sat himself down on the window-seat,
plunged both hands into trousers pockets and
frowned intently at his shoes. He didn’t get much
studying done that hour.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>THE PLAN</small></h2>


<p>There was hard practice that afternoon in preparation
for the Musket Hill Academy game, and the
second squad, in process of becoming the second
team, with a coach and signals of its own, was
sent against the first for three long periods.
Myron found himself with the third squad, as
usual, however, and ended practice with a half-hour
scrimmage against the substitutes. Perhaps
Cummins’ words had made an impression, for he
certainly played good, hard ball today and ran
rings around the opposing ends and backs. As
they played on the second team gridiron, while
the first team was battling, his performance was
not noted by the coach. But Keene, an end who
was off with a bad ankle and who refereed the
scrimmage, saw and casually made mention of
Myron’s work to Jud Mellen later.</p>

<p>“That chap Foster played a nifty game today,”
said Keene. “He might bear watching, Jud.”</p>

<p>“Foster? Yes, he’s not half bad. If we didn’t
have so many good halves he might be useful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Best we can do for him, though, is to carry him
over for next year, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s a pretty player. It seems too bad
to waste him. How would he fit at end?”</p>

<p>“Looking for a chance to retire?” laughed Jud.
“What would we do with another end, Larry?
Have a heart, man!”</p>

<p>“Well, but he ought to be tried somewhere, just
the same, Jud. He plays so blamed smooth!”</p>

<p>“I wonder if he’d make a quarter.” Jud
paused in the act of lacing a shoe and stared
speculatively at a grated and dusty window. Then
he shook his head. “I guess we’re good enough at
quarter. We’ll know better after Saturday’s
game, though. How’s the foot getting on? Going
to be able to play a bit?”</p>

<p>“Sure! It’s coming on fine. I’ll be good for
the whole game.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you will, son! A couple of quarters is
about your stunt, I guess. Driscoll wants to give
O’Curry a show, anyway. Know what I think?
Well, I think Musket Hill’s going to give us a
tough old tussle. They’ve got almost every lineman
they had last year and the same quarter;
and you know what the score was last time.”</p>

<p>“Twelve to ten, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it ought to have been turned around,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
for they played us to a standstill in the second
half. Driscoll’s firm for starting with a second-string
line, but I don’t like it. That Musket Hill
coach is a fox. If they get a score on us in the
first quarter we’ll be lucky to pass them.”</p>

<p>“They play hard ball, and that’s no joke,”
agreed Keene. “I hope he pulls me out before
Grafton gets in.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Graf?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I can’t seem to get on with
him. I think he plays too much for the centre of
the line. There’s always a hole there and I get
about two yards more of territory to look after.
You keep your place, but Grafton sort of wanders
in.”</p>

<p>“Glad you spoke of it,” answered Jud. “I’ll
watch him. Going over?”</p>

<p>Up to a half-hour after supper Myron was
convinced that he had no intention of visiting
Cummins that evening. Cummins was a lot more
decent than he had thought him, in fact a rather
likable fellow, but he had a disagreeable way
of saying things that&mdash;well, didn’t need to be
said. Besides, there was something almost indecent
in telling another that you liked him and
asking him to be pals! Even if Cummins had
taken a fancy to him, as he declared, at least he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
might have kept it to himself. But when supper
was over and Myron had turned on the steam in
Number 17&mdash;the evenings were getting decidedly
chilly now&mdash;and settled himself to write a letter
home, Cummins’ freckled countenance insisted on
obtruding itself between him and the sheet of
grey, yellow-monogrammed paper. Joe had not returned
to the room and, when the letter was written
and he had brushed up on Latin and math.,
he would be pretty well bored, he supposed. He
got as far as “Dear Mother and Father: I didn’t
get this letter written yesterday because I was
very busy&mdash;&mdash;” Then, after trying to recall what
he had been busy with and fiddling with the self-filling
device on his pen for a good ten minutes,
he gave it up. He guessed he’d walk over and hear
what Cummins’ plan was. Not that it interested
him any, but he didn’t feel like writing just now.</p>

<p>Cummins himself answered Myron’s knock,
although the battered door of Number 16 bore not
only his card but that of “Guy Henry Brown,” to
the end of which name some facetious person had
added the letters “D.D.” Brown, who played right
half on the first team, was not at home, however,
and Cummins, stretched out along the window-seat,
was the sole occupant of the room. The
room served as study and chamber both, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
narrow, white-enamelled bed stood against the
wall on each side. The rest of the furnishings
were nondescript and had evidently seen long
service. A few posters adorned the painted walls
and the carpet was so threadbare in places that
one had to guess at the original pattern and hue.
Nevertheless, there was a comfortable and home-like
look to Number 16 which Myron acknowledged.
Cummins tore himself from the book he
was reading with unflattering deliberateness and
indicated a shabby automatic rocking-chair.</p>

<p>“Try the Nerve Dispeller,” he invited. “So
called because when used your own nerves leave
you and go to the other chap, who has to watch
you rock. It’s all right; it won’t go over; that’s
just its playful way.”</p>

<p>“What were you reading?” asked Myron, by
way of conversation.</p>

<p>Chas held the book up and the visitor was surprised
to see that it was what he mentally called
“a kid’s story.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” he murmured.</p>

<p>Chas grinned. “I know, but I like them.
They’re easy to understand and there’s generally
something doing all through; and you can’t say
that for these novels some of the fellows pretend
to read. I tried to wade through one last summer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Nothing happened until I got to page 112,
and then the hero changed his shoes. Maybe he
changed back again later, but I ducked. Well, how
are you tonight?”</p>

<p>“Me? All right, thanks.” Myron wondered
why he had said “Me,” and then realised that
he had caught the trick from Joe. “I had a letter
to write, but I couldn’t seem to get at it, and so I
thought I’d drop over and see&mdash;hear&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That plan? Well, it’s a good one. Put your
feet up here, will you, and keep that thing still?
Do you mind? It pretty nearly sets me crazy to
talk to any one who’s bobbing back and forth like
one of those china mandarins! I’d have chucked
that chair long ago, only Guy hates it worse than
I do. Do you know him, by the way? Guy Brown:
plays right half on the first.”</p>

<p>“Only to speak to. I’m not well acquainted
amongst the ministry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that? Some fresh youth wrote that and
a couple of days afterwards Hale called&mdash;Do you
have him in physics? He lives down the hall&mdash;and
said it was sacrilegious. But I told him it
stood for ‘Decent Dub’ and he calmed down. Say,
Foster, can you keep a secret?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>

<p>“There’s no ‘of course’ about it,” said Chas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
“Lot’s of fellows can’t. I’m not very good at it
myself. But I guess you’re one of the kind who
can. Well, here it is. I’m going to be captain
next year.”</p>

<p>“Are you? Captain of what?” asked Myron
politely.</p>

<p>“Football, you chump! What did you think,
the Tennis Team?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Myron stared, wondering whether the
other was joking. But Chas appeared to be quite
in earnest and returned Myron’s gaze with an
expression of bland inquiry.</p>

<p>“Does that interest you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It interests me to know how you know you
are,” said Myron.</p>

<p>“Of course. Remember that it’s a secret. If
you ever tell any one what I’ve just said I’ll draw
and quarter you and frizzle you crisp in boiling
oil. I know it, old chap, because I’m after the
job, and what I go after I get. Unless some dark
horse develops between now and the Kenwood
game I’m certain to get it. So we’ll call that
settled, shall we?”</p>

<p>“Just as you say,” laughed Myron. “If you
want it, though, I hope you get it.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. Of course, I realise that it isn’t usual
to mention such matters. You’re not supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
know that there is such a thing as a captaincy.
When you get it you nearly die of surprise. Well,
that’s not me. I’m after it. Mean to get it, too.
I wouldn’t say this to every fellow because most of
them would be so shocked at my&mdash;my indelicacy
they’d never get over it. Besides which, they’d
probably vote against me.” Chas chuckled. “So
can you if you like, Foster. I’m not making a
bid for your vote.”</p>

<p>“I’m not likely to have one,” replied Myron
drily.</p>

<p>“You will have if my plan works out. Now you
listen. If I’m going to captain next year’s team&mdash;and
I am, old chap; don’t you doubt it!&mdash;I want
some players around me. I don’t want to run up
against Kenwood and get licked. That might
do when some other fellow’s running things, but
not when I am. No, I want some real players
with me, Foster. So I’m building my team this
fall.”</p>

<p>Myron laughed. “Honest, Cummins, you’re the
craziest chump I ever met! Are you&mdash;are you in
earnest?”</p>

<p>“Why not? Good, practical scheme, isn’t it?
What’s wrong with it?”</p>

<p>“Well, but&mdash;you’re not captain! And how can
you build up a team when you’re not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“How? You watch me. Take your case, old
chap. Maybe you won’t make good this year.
Mind, I say <em>maybe</em>. I think you will. But if you
don’t, what?” Myron shook his head helplessly,
signifying he gave it up and that no matter what
the answer proved to be he was beyond surprise!
“Why, you’ll be A1 material for next&mdash;<em>if</em> you
keep your head up. That’s my game, to see that
you keep going and learn all the football you can
and don’t drop out of training after the season’s
over. I think basket-ball will be a good thing
for you to take up, Foster. Or you might go in
for the gymnastic team. But I won’t have you
playing baseball, so don’t get that bug in your
bonnet. Baseball’s spoiled a lot of good football
chaps. Track’s all right if you don’t overdo it.
We’ll settle all that later, though.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” agreed Myron docilely. “Don’t
mind me.”</p>

<p>Chas grinned. “Not going to&mdash;much. But you
see the idea, don’t you? What do you think of
it?”</p>

<p>“I think,” returned Myron deliberately, “that
it’s one of the craziest schemes I ever heard of.”</p>

<p>Chas looked much pleased. “All right. And
then what?”</p>

<p>“And I think it may work out beautifully.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure it will! So that’s why I went after you,
old chap. You’re a ‘prospect.’”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Myron demurely, “I thought it
was because you had taken a violent fancy to
me.”</p>

<p>“That too! Don’t make any mistake, old chap.
I want fellows of the right sort, and I want fellows
that I like and who like me. I can do things with
that sort: they’ll work for me. And I’ll work for
them: work my fingers off if necessary. Now for
the plan.”</p>

<p>“I’m listening,” said Myron.</p>

<p>“How’d you like to get on the first this fall,
Foster?”</p>

<p>“Well, seeing that I’m black-and-blue pretty
nearly all over, that seems sort of&mdash;of idle!”</p>

<p>“Just getting black-and-blue isn’t enough, old
chap. Lots of dubs are purple-and-green that’ll
be dropped next week. Now, look here. Who told
you you were a born half-back?”</p>

<p>“No one, of course. I’ve played that position,
though, and know it. I played end for a while too,
but half seemed to be my place.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Well, we’ve got exactly five good to
middling half-backs this year, Foster, and you’re
no better than about two of them and not nearly
so good as two more, Brown and Meldrum. So,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
you see, you’re sort of up against it. See that,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. Just the same, if I had a chance
I might beat Brounker and Vance, and then, if
Brown or Meldrum&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Broke his neck you’d get in?” asked Chas impatiently.
“What’s the good of that sort of
figuring? What you want to do, old chap, is to
go after something that shows a chance of success.
That other game’s too much like waiting for dead
men’s shoes, as they say. You might get into the
big game for five minutes, or you might not. And
I’m not so dead sure that you could beat out those
fellows. And, anyway, there’s still Robbins
against you. Yes, I know he isn’t such a wonder
now, but suppose he starts to come while you’re
coming? How do you know he won’t come just as
fast, or a little bit faster? No, that’s rotten planning,
Foster. You’re all wrong. Forget that
you’re a half and go hard after a job that’s open
to you.”</p>

<p>“Where’ll I find it?” asked Myron. “What
other position is there?”</p>

<p>“Full-back,” said Chas.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>CONSPIRACY</small></h2>


<p>“Full-back!” exclaimed Myron. “Why, I never
played it! I don’t know it! I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Piffle! What’s the difference? Any chap who
can play half well can play full-back decently.
Besides, I’ve got a strong hunch that you’d make
a good one, Foster. You aren’t as heavy as I’d
like you, but you’re fast and you start quick and
you hit ’em hard. When it comes right down to it,
I’m not sure I wouldn’t as soon have a lighter
man who can jump off quick as a heavier one who
gets going slow. But the big idea about turning
you into a full-back is that you’ll have a fair show
for that position. I like Steve Kearns, but he
ought never to have been taken back from the
line. He was a mighty promising tackle last year
until Desmond got damaged and we had to have
a full-back in a hurry. As for Williams and Bob
Houghton, they aren’t more than fair. There’s
a nice job waiting for a smart, steady full-back
who’ll live on the premises and be kind to the
dogs, Foster. And I nominate you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Myron made no answer for a moment. This
thing of having some one else arrange his affairs
was a bit startling. Finally he said, doubtfully:
“Aren’t we forgetting that Driscoll and Mellen
have something to say, Cummins?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. What we’ve got to do is show
them that you are the fellow they want there.
Then they’ll simply have to have you.”</p>

<p>“It would be learning a new game, though.”</p>

<p>“Rot! The positions aren’t very different.
Just think a minute.” Myron thought. Then:</p>

<p>“How about punting?” he asked dubiously.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen you do thirty,” answered Chas.</p>

<p>“You seem to have made a life study of me,”
laughed Myron. “Yes, I can do thirty, and better,
too, I guess, but I’ve never had much of it to do
and I don’t believe that I can place my kicks,
and I don’t know how I’d get along if a bunch of
wild Indians was tearing down on me. I’d probably
get frightfully rattled and try to put the
ball down my neck, or something.”</p>

<p>“You’d need practice, of course,” Chas granted.
“I could show you a few things myself, and if you
went after the position Driscoll would see that
you got plenty of punting work. Don’t let that
worry you. The thing to do, and it may not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
so easy, is to persuade Driscoll that you have the
making of a good full-back.”</p>

<p>“Ye-es.” Myron was silent a minute. “I’d
like to ask you something, Cummins,” he said at
last.</p>

<p>“Shoot!”</p>

<p>“What other changes are you considering on the
team?”</p>

<p>Chas chuckled. “None, just now. I had
thought&mdash;but never mind that. You see, what
I want to do, Foster, is to fix things so that when
next September rolls around I’ll have the making
of a good team. A lot of this year’s bunch will
graduate, you know. I’ve got to make sure that
there’ll be other chaps to take their places. For
instance, Steve Kearns, even if he was a corking
good full-back, wouldn’t do me any good next fall
because he won’t be here. Don’t get it into your
bean that I’m queering this year’s team for the
sake of next year’s, though, because that’s not the
idea. I wouldn’t do that if I could.”</p>

<p>“I begin to believe you could, all right,” said
Myron. “I have a notion that if you thought it
would be better to have some one else captain
you’d talk Mellen into resigning!”</p>

<p>“Well, I dare say I’d try it,” laughed Chas.
“Now what do you say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“About this full-back business? Why, I’m willing,
Cummins. I’m not getting anywhere as a
half-back, and I guess I wouldn’t do much worse
at the other stunt. But what I don’t see is how
I’m to persuade the coach to let me change.”</p>

<p>“I know. I haven’t got that quite doped out
yet. I don’t believe just asking for a chance to
play full-back would do. He might fall for it,
and he might not. You let me mull that over until
tomorrow and I’ll see if I can’t hit on some
scheme. Meanwhile, if I were you I’d sort of put
myself through an exam and see how much I knew
about playing full. You might take a book that I
have along with you and read what it says about
it. It’s not a very new book, but it’s the best
that’s ever been written, and there isn’t much difference
in a full-back’s job then and now. I’ll see
you at the field tomorrow. By the way, are you
going with the team Saturday?”</p>

<p>“To North Lebron? I don’t know. I don’t suppose
Driscoll will take me with the squad, but I
might go along and see the game.”</p>

<p>“You’d better. It doesn’t hurt a fellow to see
all the football he can, even if he sees it from the
stand. Got to beat it? Well, here’s the book, old
chap. And mind, not a word to any one about
this business. It’s between you and me, Foster.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Myron found Joe and Andrew Merriman in
the room when he got back, and he took his part in
the talk for a half-hour or so. When Andrew went
he pushed his school books aside and opened the
little blue-bound volume that Cummins had loaned
him. Joe, across the table, half-hidden by the
drop-light, knotted his fingers in his hair and
groaned at intervals. At ten both boys yawned
and went to bed. Myron was not a sparkling
success in Latin class the next forenoon.</p>

<p>A three o’clock recitation made him somewhat
late for practice and Cummins was trotting about
the gridiron in signal work when he arrived at
the field. Mr. Driscoll sent him over to the second
team gridiron to join the third squad and so,
after all, he didn’t learn from Cummins whether
the latter had found a solution to their problem.
Nor did he run across Cummins again that day.
The first team was let off early, all save the
punters and goal-kickers, and Cummins had left
the gymnasium when Myron got there at half-past
five. He considered looking him up at his
room after supper, but he had rather more than
half promised Joe to go over to Merriman’s and
so decided not to.</p>

<p>There was no practice for the first the next
afternoon, but the other squads were put through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
a full day’s work. To Myron’s surprise, Cummins
took command when scrimmage time came, Coach
Driscoll disappearing from the field. Myron found
himself at left half on the second squad, with
Houghton at full-back. In that position he played
for five minutes. Then Cummins, who was evidently
very hard to please today, called a halt.</p>

<p>“That’ll do, Bob,” he told Houghton. “O
Billy! Got a full-back there?”</p>

<p>“I have not,” answered the trainer. “I’ve got
a half here. Want him?”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute.” Cummins ran his eye over
the second squad backs. “Foster, have you ever
played full?” he growled.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Myron.</p>

<p>“Want to try it? All right, fall back here.
Send your half in, Billy.”</p>

<p>Myron heartily wished that Cummins hadn’t
shifted him, for while he had a very fair notion
of a full-back’s duties, he wasn’t at all keen about
displaying his knowledge under those circumstances.
He was, he felt, bound to make a hash of
the job, and there were several fellows within a
few yards who would be tickled to death to have
him do so. He was glad he had discounted his
failure by acknowledging his inexperience. When
Cummins had asked him, he hadn’t known whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the temporary coach had expected him to say yes
or no. He didn’t know yet, but he felt that his
reply had certainly been the better one.</p>

<p>Cummins wasn’t gentle with him. Every mistake
he made, and he made many, was pointed out
to him in emphatic language. Myron wanted to
pinch himself to make certain that he wasn’t
dreaming. Cummins had conspired with him to
get him into the position of full-back and now he
was snarling and growling at him quite as though
Myron had forced himself into the place on false
pretences. Myron thought that in consideration
of the circumstances Cummins might have dealt a
little less harshly with his shortcomings. But, on
the whole, Myron didn’t do so badly. He honestly
believed that he was playing as well as the deposed
Houghton. Cummins didn’t let him punt,
for which he was grateful, and he encouraged
Warren, who was playing at quarter, to use many
end plays. Outside of tackle, Myron was usually
successful whenever he received the pigskin, and
he once or twice made good on plunges at the
centre of the line. There, however, his lack of
weight told somewhat. In the first twelve-minute
period the second squad got one touchdown and
goal and might have had a second score if Cummins
had not put them back from the eight yards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
to the eighteen on some whim of his own. Third
got the ball on downs six inches from the last
white streak and punted out of danger, and the
second was mad enough to rend Cummins limb
from limb! When a five-minute rest came Cummins
called Myron from the bench and led him
into the field. To those watching it was perfectly
evident that Chas was telling the green full-back
how absolutely rotten he was. They would have
been surprised had they heard the conversation
out there.</p>

<p>“You weren’t half bad, old chap,” said Chas
eagerly, yet scowling ferociously still. “You
slowed up once or twice when you hit the line,
though. Try to keep going hard. A good way to
do is to think of the other fellow’s goal line instead
of his players. Sort of make yourself think that’s
where you’re going. You’ll get farther before
you’re stopped, if you are stopped. How do you
like it?”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Myron, a bit grumpily.
“But considering that I’ve never played it before
it seems to me you might let up on me a bit.
You go on as if I’d murdered my grandmother!”</p>

<p>“Why, sure,” chuckled Chas. “You don’t want
those fellows to think I’m pulling for you, do you?
It’s got to look like an accident, don’t you see?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
I want to be able to tell Driscoll tonight that you
went in at full in an emergency and played a
corking good game. Then, if he has half the sense
I think he has, he will put you in there himself the
first of the week and look you over. By the way,
want to try a little punting in the next period?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’d better,” answer Myron.
“I guess I’d rather not.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’re right. If you made a mess of
a punt it would sort of take off a few good marks.
All right. Now see if you can do a little better
still this half. And don’t mind my growls, old
chap. You’re getting no worse than any other
fellow would get.”</p>

<p>Twelve more minutes of hard playing followed
in which the third turned the tables with a long
run that netted a touchdown. But the try-at-goal
failed and, after the second had battered its way
to the enemy’s twelve yards, Warren’s attempt at
a drop-kick went wide and the referee, the assistant
manager, blew his whistle. In that second
period Myron did a little better because he was
learning his duties, but it would be an exaggeration
to say that he showed phenomenal ability as
a full-back. He made several good games, gains,
was strong in defensive play and got off one very
pretty forward pass to Mistley that netted twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
yards. In short, Chas had to show a little more
enthusiasm than he actually felt when he spoke to
Coach Driscoll that evening. There had been a
final conference in the coach’s room at half-past
seven attended by the trainer, the managers and
seven of the players, and the last problem of the
morrow’s game had been solved more or less satisfactorily.
Afterwards, Chas remained behind
with Jud Mellen and Farnsworth and Harry Cater
for a sociable chat. None of them meant to talk
football, and none of them did for a full quarter
of an hour, but it is difficult to keep the subject
uppermost in the mind out of the conversation,
and presently Jud said thoughtfully:</p>

<p>“I wish we had about three more good plays,
Coach.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got enough, Cap,” was the confident
reply. “No use trying to remember too many at
this time of the season. Better know ten or twelve
well than half know twenty. It isn’t lack of plays
that will beat us tomorrow, if we <em>are</em> beaten&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sure to be,” interpolated Katie cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Well, it’ll be because we haven’t got our attack
working, then. Musket Hill is well ahead of
us in development, and that’s going to count, fellows.
However, we may show them something,
at that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“By the way, Coach,” said Chas, “I ran out of
full-backs this afternoon and used that fellow
Foster through most of two periods. He wasn’t
half rotten, if you ask me. He’d never played it
in his life, either.”</p>

<p>“Foster? What happened to Houghton?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t his day,” said Chas. “So I had to
find some one else for the second squad.”</p>

<p>“Houghton hasn’t had a day for a good while,”
murmured Farnsworth drily.</p>

<p>“For the love of Mike,” exclaimed Jud Mellen,
“if we can make a full-back of Foster, let’s
do it, Coach! It’s the weakest position on the
team right now.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking that Kearns would come
on,” said Mr. Driscoll, “but he doesn’t seem to
get the hang of it.”</p>

<p>“He works hard enough,” said Katie.</p>

<p>“How did you happen to choose Foster?”
asked the Coach of Chas. “You had Wiborg.
He’s played full.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think he was there. I asked Billy and
Billy only offered me a half.”</p>

<p>“Wiborg wasn’t out today,” explained the
manager. “He’s been having some trouble with
the Office. Nothing serious, I believe, but he asked
for a cut.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“You say Foster showed up pretty well, Cummins?”</p>

<p>“He really did, Coach. Of course, I don’t know
how he’d be at punting, but he made some mighty
good gains from kicking formation and went into
the third pretty hard from close in.”</p>

<p>“He could be taught enough punting to get
by with,” suggested Captain Mellen. “Maybe
he’ll be a find, Coach. I’ve said right along that
he looked good.”</p>

<p>“No harm in trying him,” mused Mr. Driscoll.
“If Kearns doesn’t show something tomorrow
we’ll need a good full-back. Much obliged for
the tip, Cummins. Well, good night, fellows.
Get a good sleep and be ready with the punch
tomorrow. We want that game if we can get it!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>A CHANCE ENCOUNTER</small></h2>


<p>The team left for North Lebron at eleven o’clock
the next forenoon. The town that had the honour
of containing Musket Hill Academy was not so
far away in distance, but those who had arranged
the train service had not consulted the Parkinson
School Football Team, and as a result of this
oversight there was an hour and a half to be
spent at a junction that boasted, besides a decrepit
station, only a blacksmith’s shop, a general
store and eight assorted dwellings. Myron knew
that there were eight dwellings because he counted
them twice. There wasn’t much of anything else
to do.</p>

<p>He was not journeying to North Lebron in any
official capacity, for his name had not been
amongst those announced yesterday by Manager
Farnsworth. He was going along, with some sixty
other “fans,” mostly because Chas Cummins had
insisted on his doing so. Privately, he had entertained
the thought up to an hour after breakfast
that, not having been invited to attend the contest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
as a member of the team, it would be the
part of dignity to remain away. But Chas wasn’t
greatly concerned with dignity, and he had a
masterful way with him, and the result was that
at a little before nine o’clock Myron was in possession
of the knowledge that he was going to
North Lebron at eleven-four.</p>

<p>At twelve he was seated on an edge of the platform
at the junction, juggling three pebbles in
his hand and boredly wondering what it would
be like to have to live in the fifth dwelling; the
one with the blue-green blinds and the sagging
porch and the discarded wagon-seat serving as a
porch settle. The day was positively hot for
October and few of the travellers had elected to
remain inside the coaches. Some of the school
fellows were adorning the platform, like Myron,
others were strolling about the adjacent landscape
in search of adventures, and a merry handful
were exercising the baggage truck up and down
the planks to the restrained displeasure of the
sad-looking station agent. Coming over, Myron
had shared a seat with a stranger, a lad of fourteen
or so, and had managed to pass the time in
conversation on various subjects, but now the
youngster had disappeared and no one else appeared
to care about taking his place. Joe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Chas were with the football crowd in the forward
car, and Myron had seen neither of them to speak
to since leaving Warne. Andrew Merriman had
not been able to come. In consequence, Myron had
no one to talk to and was fast reaching the decision
that he would have had more pleasure had
he remained at home. Even the assurance that he
was irreproachably arrayed in a suit of cool grey
flannel, with a cap to match, a cream-coloured
shirt and patriotic brown tie and stockings didn’t
mitigate his boredom. Of late he had been deriving
less satisfaction than of yore from his attire.
Somehow, whether his tie and stockings matched
or whether his trousers were smoothly pressed
seemed of less consequence to him. Several times
of late he had forgotten his scarf-pin!</p>

<p>His discontented musings were interrupted by
the arrival beside him of a youth of perhaps
nineteen. Myron had glimpsed him once on the
train and been struck by his good looks and by
the good taste of his attire. He wore blue serge,
but it was serge of an excellent quality and cut
to perfection. And there was a knowing touch
to the paler blue scarf with its modest moonstone
pin and something pleasantly exceptional in the
shape of the soft collar. Myron felt a kindred
interest in the tall, good-looking youth, and determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
to speak to him. But the stranger forestalled
him, for, as soon as he had seated himself
nearby on the platform edge, he turned, glancing
at Myron and remarked: “Hot, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>The stranger’s tone held just the correct mixture
of cordiality and restraint. Myron, agreeing,
felt flattered that the well-dressed youth had
singled him out. The weather, as a subject of
conversation, soon failed, but there were plenty
of other things to discuss, and at the end of ten
minutes the two were getting on famously. The
stranger managed to inform Myron without appearing
to do so that he was interested in a sporting
goods house in New Haven, that he had been
in Hartford on business and that, having nothing
better to do today, he had decided to run over to
North Lebron and see the game between Musket
Hill and Parkinson. “I fancy you’re a Parkinson
fellow?” he said questioningly. And when
Myron acknowledged the fact: “A fine school, I’ve
heard. I’ve never been there. Warne’s off my
territory. I’ve been thinking, though, that some
day I’d run over and see if I could do any business
there. I suppose you chaps buy most of your
athletic supplies in New York.”</p>

<p>“I think so. There’s one store in Warne that
carries a pretty fair line of goods, though.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think I’ll have to try your town. Parkinson’s
rather a big place, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“We have over five hundred fellows this year.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? Why, there ought to be some
business there for my house. I suppose you chaps
go in for most everything: football, baseball,
hockey, tennis? How about track athletics?”</p>

<p>“There’s a track team,” answered Myron, “but
this is my first year and I don’t know much about
it yet.”</p>

<p>“I see.” The other looked appraisingly and,
Myron thought, even admiringly over his new
acquaintance. “I say, you look as if you ought
to be playing football yourself, old man. Or is
baseball your game?”</p>

<p>“Football, but I’m not on the first. It’s hard
work breaking in at Parkinson.”</p>

<p>“Good guess of mine, wasn’t it?” laughed the
other. “Thought you had the build for a good
football man. I meet a good many of them, you
see. How’s this team you’ve got ahead there?
Going to lick Musket Hill this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I hope so. I have an idea that
our coach rather expects a hard game, though.
I’ve heard that Musket Hill is further along than
we are.”</p>

<p>“Those fellows play good football,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
stranger. “I’ve seen them in action once or twice.
I hope you chaps get away with the game, but my
opinion is that you’ll have to go some to do it.
Got some good men on your team?”</p>

<p>Myron was quite willing to sing the praises of
Parkinson, and during the ensuing half-hour <a href="#image03">the
stranger was treated to quite a fund of information</a>
regarding the school, the football team and
Myron Warrenton Foster. Football, though,
seemed to interest the tall youth most of all, and
several times Myron was turned back to that subject
by polite questions. When the train from the
south pulled in the two were still conversing and
it was but natural that they should share a seat
for the remainder of the journey. The stranger
could talk interestingly himself and the last part
of the trip was occupied with absorbing and even
startling adventures met with by him in his business
trips. More than once Myron’s credulity
was severely taxed, but a glance at the narrator’s
frank and pleasing countenance dispelled all suspicions
of mendacity. Myron found this chance
acquaintance so interesting that he rather hoped
they might witness the game together, but when
North Lebron was reached the stranger announced
that he had one or two errands to attend to before
going up to the field.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maybe I’ll run across you there&mdash;er&mdash;What’s
the name, by the way?”</p>

<p>“Foster.”</p>

<p>“Mine’s Millard. I haven’t a card with me.
Wish I had. But, I say, Foster, if you don’t
mind I’d like to look you up if I get to Warne.
Those little towns are dull holes if you don’t know
any one in them.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would!” said Myron. “You’ll find
me in 17 Sohmer Hall. Can you remember that?”</p>

<p>“Sohmer, you said? Number 17? I’ll remember,
Foster. Awfully glad to have met you. It’s
jolly nice to run across a chap who’s&mdash;well, a
chap who has your own views on things, if you get
me.” He shook hands cordially, evidently regretfully.
“I’ll try to find you at the game, old man.
If I don’t, look for me in your burg before long.
I’m going to have a go at that dealer you spoke
of.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try and save a seat for you if you think
you’re likely to find me,” offered Myron.</p>

<p>But the other waved a hand. “Don’t bother.
I can squeeze in. And I may be rather late in
getting there. Good-bye and good luck. Hope
you beat ’em!”</p>

<p>That encounter restored both Myron’s self-esteem
and good humour, and he enjoyed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
sandwich and pie and milk which he ate in company
with half a hundred other youths at the
little lunch-room on the way uptown. Later,
wandering by himself through the leaf-strewn
streets about the school campus, he came across
Joe and Paxton Cantrell, the latter a sturdy, wide-shouldered
youth who was playing his second&mdash;and
last&mdash;season at centre. Cantrell left them
a minute or two later to speak to an acquaintance
and Myron and Joe walked on to the school gymnasium
together.</p>

<p>“They fed us at a hotel down there by the station,”
said Joe sadly, “and I want to tell you that
not one of us over-ate. Everything came to us in
bird baths and you needed a microscope to find the
contents. Norris lost his roast beef and didn’t
find it until he was through dinner, and where
do you suppose it was?”</p>

<p>“In his lap, I guess.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, it had slipped under his thumb-nail!”</p>

<p>Myron told of the stranger encountered at the
junction and was quite full of his subject, but Joe
didn’t seem to find it interesting and soon interrupted
to point out a building. “What do you
suppose that is?” he asked. “Looks like a factory
of some sort, don’t it? Only it ain’t&mdash;hasn’t got
any chimneys, as far as I can see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maybe it’s a hospital or something,” replied
Myron. “He says he’s coming to Warne pretty
soon and will look me up. I’d like to have you
meet him, Joe.”</p>

<p>“Who’s this?”</p>

<p>“Why, Millard, the chap I was speaking of,”
answered Myron disgustedly.</p>

<p>“Oh! Glad to know him. Which street do we
take now?”</p>

<p>They parted at the gymnasium and Myron
joined the throng pressing toward the field, a
short block away. He looked for Millard, but
didn’t see him. Later, during the intermission, he
thought he caught sight of him in the throng behind
the Musket Hill bench, but others intervened
and he was not able to make certain.</p>

<p>The game started at half-past two, by which
time the morning heat had been somewhat abated
by a fresh breeze that blew across the oval field and
fluttered the big maroon banner above the covered
stand that held the Musket Hill rooters. Parkinson’s
sixty odd supporters, grouped together on
the other side of the field, did valiant service with
their voices, but to Myron it seemed that their
contribution to the din that prevailed as the two
teams trotted on together was very slight. He
was wedged in between a stout youth named Hollis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
whom he instinctively disliked because of his
high-pitched voice, and a studious-appearing boy
in spectacles whose name he didn’t know. Hollis
had vindicated Myron’s verdict before the teams
had finished warming up by showing himself to
be one of those cock-sure, opinionated and loud-talking
youths of which every school is possessed.
His neighbour at his left elbow proved inoffensive
and only once during the game uttered any sound
that Myron could hear. Then, while every one
else was on his feet, shouting and gesticulating,
the spectacled youth smiled raptly and murmured,
“Oh, bully indeed!”</p>

<p>Myron purchased a score-card from a boy with
a maroon band about his arm, exchanging a bright
ten cent piece for a flimsy, smoochy slip of paper
that, so far as the visiting team was concerned,
was as untruthful as it was unlovely. The card
declared that “Mullen” would play left tackle
for Parkinson, that “Sawtrell” was her centre
and that “Wildram” was the name of her left
half-back. Myron corrected these misstatements
when Captain Mellen had trotted his warriors out
on the field, and some others besides, for Coach
Driscoll had sent five substitutes to the fray, four
linemen and a back. When Myron had got
through making over his score-card it looked like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
one of his corrected English compositions and
read as follows: Stearns, l.e.; Mellen, l.t.; Brodhead,
l.g.; Cantrell, c.; Dobbins, r.g.; Flay, r.t.;
Grove, r.e.; Cater, q.b.; Brounker, l.h.; Brown,
r.h.; Kearns, f.b.</p>

<p>Myron was glad that Joe was to have his chance
in a real game, and for the first period watched
his room-mate so closely that the general aspect
of the game was quite lost on him and he came
to with a start when the teams changed fields,
realising that however nicely Joe had played&mdash;and
he had played well: there was no question about
that&mdash;the eleven as a whole had failed to show
anything resembling real football. While neither
team had found its gait, Musket Hill had already
threatened the visitors’ goal and only a sad fumble
had held her away from it. And now, with the
second ten-minute period beginning, the ball was
again in the Maroon’s possession on Parkinson’s
thirty-three yards. Myron sat up and took notice,
deciding to let Joe play his game unaided by
telepathic waves from the grandstand!</p>

<p>Musket Hill was a heavy team, although her
players got their weight from height rather than
breadth. They were, almost without exception,
tall, rangey youths with an extremely knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
manner of handling themselves. Myron’s brow
clouded as he watched that first play after the
whistle. Musket Hill used an open formation,
with her backs side by side a full pace further
distant than usual. From this formation, with
the quarter frequently joining the line of backs
at left or right, Musket Hill worked a variety of
plays: straight plunges at centre, delayed passes
sliding off tackle, quarter-back runs, even punts,
the latter, thanks to a steady bunch of forwards,
never threatened with disaster. The Maroon
played a shifty game, changing her plays often,
seldom attacking the same place twice no matter
what gains might result. Toward the end the
latter rule did not hold good, but for three full
periods she observed it rigorously, even to the impatience
and protests of her supporters. Before
that second period was three minutes old she had
settled down into her stride and demonstrated
the fact that, whatever favours of fortune might
occur, on the basis of ability alone she was more
than a match for her opponent.</p>

<p>The Maroon secured her first score less than
three minutes from the start of the second quarter
as unexpectedly as deftly, and Myron and his companions
on the west stand had scarcely recovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
from their surprise by the time the goal was
kicked! The ball had been on Parkinson’s forty-two
yards, after Musket Hill had punted, caught
again and carried the pigskin four yards in two
downs. The Maroon’s trick of punting from that
three-man formation, and close to the line, had
got the enemy worried. The latter was never
quite certain when an unexpected kick would go
over a back’s head, for Musket Hill punted without
rule or reason, it seemed. To keep two men
up the field at all times was impossible, and so
Parkinson compromised and put Brown midway
between the line and Cater. As Musket Hill had
netted but four yards in two downs, it was fair to
assume that she was just as likely to kick on the
third down as to rush, and Brown edged further
back at Cater’s call. But Musket Hill did the unexpected.
There was a quick, dazzling movement
behind her line and then the ball arched away to
her left. Somehow an end was under it when it
came down and, although Stearns almost foiled
him, caught it and reached the five-yard line before
he was seriously challenged by Brodhead.
He had kept close to the side-line, and Brown,
playing well back, was his nearest foe when the
twenty-five-yard line was reached. But Brown
never had a chance, for a Musket Hill youth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
brought him low, while a second effectively disposed
of Cater a moment after. Brodhead alone
stood for an instant between the Brown and
disaster&mdash;none ever knew how he had managed to
get back to the five yards&mdash;and for a heart-beat it
seemed that the runner was doomed. But Brodhead’s
tackle only spun the red-legged runner
about and sent him across the final white line like
a top in its last gyrations.</p>

<p>A well-kicked goal added another point to the
six, and the teams went back to the centre of the
field once more. To Myron it seemed then that
Parkinson realised defeat, for there was that in
the attitudes and movements of the players that
had not been there before. It was not dejection,
but it might have been called the ghost of it. And
yet for the remainder of the period Parkinson took
and held the upper hand and the half ended with
the ball in her possession on her forty-eight yards.</p>

<p>Myron wanted to talk over the game very badly,
but the youth with spectacles was doing what appeared
to be an intricate problem in algebra on the
back of his score-card, while as for the stout boy
on his other side, he had heard enough of his
conversation already. Just now he was knowingly
informing his companion that the trouble with
Parkinson was that she needed a decent coach.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
His brief glimpse of Millard&mdash;if it really was Millard&mdash;distracted
him for a moment or two, and
after that he listened to the joyful sounds from
the Musket Hill side and felt rather disappointed
and lonesome.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>MYRON GETS HIS CHANCE</small></h2>


<p>I should like to tell how Parkinson found herself
in the last half of the game and won the contest.
But nothing of that sort happened. Coach Driscoll
started the third period with all his regulars
in the line, and, in consequence, Musket Hill found
slower going. Gains in the line were far less frequent,
and only outside of tackles was the Maroon
likely to win territory. But the home team clearly
out-punted the visitors, although, in the final
period, Garrison was pulled back from the line
to swing his toe for Parkinson. Musket Hill made
but one long advance in the last twenty minutes,
and, as before, a forward pass was the method
chosen. Keene, who had taken Stearns’ place at
left end, was caught napping badly, and Meldrum,
the left half, who should have seen the signs and
been on guard, found himself tied up with the
enemy. The result was a fine thirty-seven yard
gain that placed the pigskin on Parkinson’s nine
yards.</p>

<p>From a Parkinson point of view, the most encouraging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
feature of the day developed then when
the Brown line, forced back to its six yards and
then to its four, and finally retired to its two for
being off-side, stood firm and took the ball away
a foot from her goal-line. It was then that the
west stand shouted and cheered and that Myron,
silent a moment for want of breath, heard his
spectacled neighbour give vent to the enthusiastic
remark already recorded. But no team can win
who can’t score, and Parkinson couldn’t score. On
attack she was decidedly weak. The ability was
there, but the team had not yet learned to make
use of it. Individually, nearly every fellow in
the Brown line played really excellent football, but
teamwork was missing. For a brief four or five
minutes at the beginning of the last quarter there
came a semblance of it, and Parkinson, securing
the ball on a punt near her thirty yards, managed
to work it down to the enemy’s thirty. Guy
Brown was the bright particular star, and, aided
by Meldrum, tore off gain after gain through a
weakened left side of the enemy’s ranks. But
when Musket Hill brought in two substitutes to
bolster the point of attack the advance petered
out, and when Brown had twice failed to gain and
Kearns had lost a yard on a wide end run, Parkinson
was forced to punt. That punt marked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
end of Parkinson’s defiance. From then on she
plugged away doggedly to avert a worse defeat
and, aided by the over-zealousness of Musket Hill’s
several substitutes and by the sharp-eyed officials,
succeeded. When the final whistle blew Parkinson
was down on her twelve yards, her back again to
the wall, and only that whistle saved her.</p>

<p>Musket Hill appeared more than satisfied with
her score of 7 to 0. It was only her second victory
over Parkinson in many years of contest, although
there had been ties and close scores, and Myron,
standing in his place with the other Parkinsonians
and cheering bravely, witnessed a hilarious celebration
as Musket Hill overflowed the field and
began a sinuous snake-dance from side to side
and from goal to goal. Then came a hurried
scramble for the four-forty-eight train and a
tedious and, for his part, dejected journey back
to Warne. He hoped that Millard would show up,
although that engaging youth hadn’t spoken of
returning by that train. He didn’t, however, and
Myron had a dull time of it.</p>

<p>The next afternoon, being Sunday, he and Joe
visited Andrew Merriman, and later they rescued
Zephaniah from his box-stall and, accompanied by
that joyous companion, took a long walk into the
country. The afternoon was ideal, although too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
warm for brisk walking. Andrew spied some butternut
trees up a lane and they prospected. But
the nuts were still green, for no hard frosts had
visited them yet. The boys found a sunny spot
nearby and stretched themselves out on a bank of
ferns and Zephaniah had a monstrous adventure
with a cricket and got tangled in a blackberry vine
and fell off a stone wall and, in short, spent the
most glorious hour of his young life.</p>

<p>Andrew and Joe did most of the talking that
afternoon. Myron was in a rather gloomy frame
of mind, although he couldn’t have found any explanation
for the fact. Andrew rallied him once
on the score of his silence, and Myron said he was
tired. After that he really thought he was. Joe
was in high spirits. He had been pitted against
a worthy adversary yesterday and, during the
time he had faced him, had had a glorious time.
Every one said that he had outplayed his opponent,
and Joe knew it. He regretted that Mr.
Driscoll had seen fit to put Garrison in his place
in the last half, however, earnestly assuring
Andrew and Myron that if he had stayed in he
would have had “that guy Fraser eating out of
my hand in the last quarter!” But a good tussle
always cheered Joe up wonderfully, and the effects
of that strenuous twenty minutes lasted him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
for several days: just as a fine big vari-coloured
lump under his left eye did!</p>

<p>When Myron returned to Sohmer at dusk he
found a scrawled note from Chas Cummins. “No
one home!” he read. “Looked for you on the
train coming back, but couldn’t find you. What
do you know about us? Looks like Fortune
favours the brave and all that sort of thing,
doesn’t it? Watch for developments tomorrow!
Yours, C.C.”</p>

<p>Myron found the note somewhat cryptic. For
a minute he thought of going around to see Chas
in the evening, but then he decided that if Chas
had wanted to see him he would have said so.
As a result, he stayed at home and did some
much-needed studying.</p>

<p>Monday afternoon found a number of the regulars
absent from practice. The game on Saturday
had been a strenuous one and several of the
players had earned a rest. Chas was on hand,
however, although not in togs, and the same was
true of Jud Mellen. Cantrell and Garrison and
Cater were absent, and one or two others, and the
first squad had a sort of shot-to-pieces look. Dummy
practice started the proceedings, and, since
much poor tackling had been shown in the Musket
Hill contest, the drill was a long one. It seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
to Myron that every one had nerves today, from
Coach Driscoll down to the last and least important
substitute. Manager Farnsworth, pulling
the rope that shot the canvas dummy across the
trolley, was short of speech and jerky of manner,
Jud Mellen, watching grimly from beside the
freshly-spaded pit, frowned and twisted his hands
about in his uprolled sweater and made biting
comments, and even Billy Goode, normally sweet-tempered
as a cherub, looked and spoke as if some
one had been casting aspersions on Ireland! Only
Chas, grinning like a catfish, appeared unaffected
by the general epidemic. Chas joked and jollied
and got himself thoroughly hated by all.</p>

<p>Back on the gridiron, Coach Driscoll called
Myron from the bench and fixed him with a calculating
eye. Myron had visions of clearing out
his locker and retiring from football affairs. But
what the coach said was: “Cummins tells me he
had you at full-back the other day. Ever played
there?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not until Friday.”</p>

<p>“You’re a half, aren’t you? Well, we’ve got
plenty of those, such as they are. Think you could
learn full-back? Ever done any punting?”</p>

<p>“Some, yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Get a ball and show me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>Over on the second gridiron, with a substitute
back to catch or chase, Myron swung his foot and
dropped the ball and saw it go off at a tangent,
and heard the coach say: “Take your time,
Foster; you’ve got all day.” When the back had
relayed the pigskin from the first team gridiron
and Myron had it again in his hands he decided to
try to forget that the coach was watching. The
result was much better, for the ball went straight
toward the other goal and into the waiting arms
of the back. The punt wasn’t long, but it had
been true, and Mr. Driscoll nodded hopefully.</p>

<p>“Try it again,” he ordered, “and hold your
leg straighter. Lock your knee and keep it
so.”</p>

<p>After the next attempt he called down the field.
“Where did you catch that, Morton?” he asked.
The back turned and counted the lines.</p>

<p>“About the forty, sir,” he shouted.</p>

<p>“Not bad,” commented the coach. “We’re on
the twenty-five here. Try a low one now. And
follow through with your foot. Don’t stop when
you strike the ball: keep your foot going right
on up: there’s plenty of room for it!”</p>

<p>Four more punts, varying in distance from a
wretched twenty yards to a glorious forty-five,
followed, Myron seeking to profit by the coach’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
instructions. Then: “I guess that’s enough,
Foster,” said Mr. Driscoll. “You’ll stand a lot
of practice, but you’ve got a good swing and I
wouldn’t be surprised if you could make a pretty
fair punter. I’ll give you a chance to show what
you can do at full-back. If you buckle down and
try hard you’ll stand a chance of a place, for we
need another man there. Wish you had about
ten more pounds on you, though. Go around
with Warren’s squad over there for a while and
watch how Houghton does it. I’ll see you
again.”</p>

<p>Blanket-wrapped, for Billy Goode had sharp
eyes for his charges and the weather had turned
colder overnight, Myron followed the first team
substitutes in their signal practice for a good
twenty minutes. Now and then he caught Chas
Cummins’ eye as the squad trotted by, but that
youth’s expression was blank and innocent. Finally
the benches filled again, coach and captain
and manager compared notes like three gentleman
burglars meditating a midnight sortie, the
trainer busied himself with blankets and the
sparse audience on the stand kicked their feet
against the boards to put warmth into them.
Then Mr. Driscoll faced the benches.</p>

<p>“First and second squads,” he called. “First<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
will kick off. Second, take this goal. Who’s
playing right half for the second? You, Robbins?
Well, we want you on the first. Morton, you go
to the second. All right now? What’s that,
Grove? Left tackle? Oh, all right. Simkins!
Go in on the first: left tackle. All right, Hersey!
Start it up!”</p>

<p>Myron wondered if the coach had forgotten his
promise, for Williams was playing full-back on the
first squad and Houghton on the second and he,
Myron, was adorning the bench with some twenty-odd
other subs. Perhaps Mr. Driscoll had changed
his mind, thought Myron. At that moment Chas
called to him and led him down the side-line a
ways. “Drop your blanket, old chap,” he said.
“Coach says I’m to pass you a few, though I’m
blessed if I know how he expects me to work in
a pair of trousers that are two inches too small
for me! Get over there by the end of the stand.
If you miss them you won’t have to chase them so
far. Now then, perhaps you know that in the
modern game of football, the full-back is called on
to take the snap-back straight from the centre on
numerous occasions. Well, I’m the gentlemanly
centre for the nonce. That’s a bully word, ‘nonce.’
Now we will suppose”&mdash;Chas’ voice diminished
to a murmur as he turned his back and placed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
ball he had brought on the sod before him. Myron
spread his hands as he had seen Houghton do,
Chas cast a backward glance at him and swept
the ball toward him. By leaping two feet off the
earth Myron was just able to tip it with his
fingers. Chas laughed delightedly.</p>

<p>“Gee, that’s just like Cantrell does it!” he
exulted. “In fact, I believe I got it two or three
inches higher than he ever did. Guess I’ll get
Driscoll to let me play centre!”</p>

<p>Myron recovered the ball and tossed it back.
“Maybe I’d better get a soap-box or something
to stand on,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“None of your lip, my lad! Watch your step,
now!”</p>

<p>This time the ball came straight and shoulder
high, and Myron caught it, shifted it to the crook
of his left arm and dived forward. “Splendidly
done, old chap!” applauded Chas. “Quite professional.
Any one can play full-back if he has a
good centre like me to pass to him, though. Now,
then, here we go again!”</p>

<p>Chas kept it up until he was red in the face from
stooping and Myron was tired of it, and only
stopped, as he said, because he had heard a suspicious
ripping sound in the neighbourhood of
his waist. “It’s all right,” he explained a trifle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
breathlessly, “to die for your school, but no one
wants to bust his trousers for it!”</p>

<p>On the way back to the bench Myron said:
“What did you mean in your note about Fortune,
Cummins? I didn’t get that. Sorry I was out, by
the way.”</p>

<p>“I meant that things were coming our way,
old chap. Didn’t you observe what a mess of
things Steve Kearns made Saturday?”</p>

<p>“Not especially. I guess I wasn’t watching
Kearns much.”</p>

<p>“And you grooming for his place! What do
you know about you? Well, poor old Steve balled
up everything he tried. Every time he got the
ball he lost a yard. If they’d turned him around
he’d have won the game for us! Between you and
me and the bucket there, Foster, you’ve got the
chance of a life-time to land on all four feet right
square behind the first team. All you’ve got to
do is show horse-sense, old chap, and be willing
to learn. By the way, you got off a couple of nice
punts over there.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see, though, why I couldn’t have had
a show at half,” said Myron dubiously. “I don’t
know enough about playing full-back, Cummins.
I may make an awful mess of it.”</p>

<p>“If you do,” was the grim reply, “I’ll knock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the feathers off you. But you won’t. You mustn’t.
Doggone it, son, this is your big chance! You’ve
just got to make good! Remember there’s another
year coming!”</p>

<p>“I’ll try, of course, Cummins, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But me no buts! You keep in mind&mdash;There’s
Driscoll calling you. Go to it, old chap!”</p>

<p>“Go in on the second there at full-back, Foster.
You know the signals, don’t you? All right. Now
show something. Warren, give your full-back
some work. Come on, first! Get into it! Let’s
see some playing!”</p>

<p>The whistle piped before Myron had settled into
position, however, and he went back to the bench
with the rest and listened to criticism and instruction
and moistened his throat with water and half
wished that Chas Cummins had let him alone.
But, back on the field presently, with the ball arching
away overhead, he forgot his stage-fright and
gripped his nose-guard with his teeth and piled
into the play. Warren, acting on instructions,
gave him plenty of work, and he didn’t do it so
badly, all things considered. At least, he made
three good gains and he got away two punts, one
of which surprised him. On defence he showed
up decidedly well, and Warren, an earnest little
shock-headed youth, gave him praise more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
once. He had some bad moments, as when, ball
in hand for a toss to O’Curry across the line, he
found himself besieged by two rampant first team
forwards who had somehow broken through, and,
unable to heave, let himself be forced back many
yards. Afterwards, he told himself aggrievedly
that Warren had no right to call on him for a
forward-pass, that he had never had much of it to
do and couldn’t be expected to be proficient. Besides,
if your line let the whole opposing team
through on top of you, what <em>could</em> you do, anyway?</p>

<p>How Coach Driscoll had been impressed, Myron
had no means of knowing. The coach made no
comments. Myron concluded that he had failed to
make good, and he dressed himself and went back
to Sohmer in a rather depressed state of mind.
But after supper Chas breezed in and relieved
him. “Rotten? Nothing of the sort!” declared
Chas. “You were positively good, old chap! I’ll
bet Driscoll is scratching Houghton this minute
and writing ‘Foster’ in his little red book. If you
don’t find yourself playing full-back again tomorrow
I’ll&mdash;I’ll eat my hat. And I need it,
too, having none other. You didn’t see our young
friend, did you, Dobbins?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Joe. “I wasn’t out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, he’s the coming marvel. There’s no
doubt about it. All he’s got to do is learn the
position.”</p>

<p>Joe and Myron laughed, the former the more
merrily. “That sounds sort of like a real job,”
he commented.</p>

<p>“It isn’t, really,” answered Chas earnestly.
“You see, Foster knows all the moves but he
doesn’t know where to fit them in. After all, playing
football is playing football, whether you’re in
the line or back of it, Dobbins. I’ll bet that, if I
had to, I could step into any position on the team
tomorrow and get by with it. I don’t say I’d be
a wonder, but I’d do the trick fairly well. That
may sound like conceited guff, but it’s a fact, fellows.
Foster’s played half, and a full-back’s only
a half with another name and a few different
things to do. He’ll learn in a week. I’ve got all
my money on him to win. I’m tickled, too. When
Foster came to me and asked if I thought he
could play full-back&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“When I <em>what</em>?” gasped Myron.</p>

<p>Chas winked and frowned. “When he sprung
that on me, Dobbins, I had my doubts. But I said
the right thing. I said, ‘Go to it, my boy, and good
luck to you!’ I’m glad I did. We surely need
more full-backs than we’ve got, and I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Foster’s going to be a good one. Well, I’m off.
By the way, Dobbins, you played a pretty game
Saturday. I’ll have to watch my step or you’ll
have me on the bench. Good night!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>DOCTOR LANE INTERVENES</small></h2>


<p>Chas Cummins proved a good prophet. On the
following day Myron slipped into a niche in the
first team, one of many hopeful, hard-working
youths known as “first team subs.” For a few
days, indeed, until after the Phillipsburg game, he
was dazed by the sudden leap from obscurity to
conspicuity, from what he termed neglect to what
was extremely like solicitude. Not that his arrival
at the field for practice was the occasion for
shouts of acclaim and a fanfare of trumpets, for
those at the helm did not show their interest in
promising candidates in any such manner, but
at last he was quite certain that coach and captain,
managers and trainer, were aware of his existence.
There were times when he heartily wished that
they knew less of it. Some one was forever at
his elbow, criticising, explaining, exhorting.
Coach Driscoll and Ned Garrison oversaw his
punting practice, Snow lugged him to remote
corners of the playfield to make him catch passes,
Katie drilled him in signals, every one, it seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
to Myron, was having a finger in his pie. And
when he was not being privately coached, as it
were, he was legging it around the gridiron with
the substitutes or tumbling about the dummy pit
with a bundle of stuffed and dirty canvas clasped
to his bosom. Those were busy, confusing days.
And yet no one outside the football “inner ring”
appeared to be aware of the fact that a new light
had arisen in the Parkinson firmament. Not unnaturally,
perhaps, Myron looked for signs of
interest, even of awe, from his acquaintances, but
he found none. At table in dining hall Eldredge
still glowered at him, Rogers cringed and the
pestiferous Tinkham poked sly fun. Only Joe and
Andrew and Chas, among his friends, showed him
honour; and Joe as a strewer of blossoms in his
path was not an overwhelming success. Joe
seemed to think that his chum’s leap to incipient
fame was pleasing but not remarkable, while
Myron was absolutely certain that it was stupendous
and unparalleled in the annals of preparatory
school football. When you are watched and
guided as Myron was by those in command you are
likely to think that. He wondered whether Joe
was not just a little bit envious. Of course, Joe’s
position was quite as assured as his own, but Joe
had not engaged the time and attention and solicitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
of the entire coaching force. He hoped Joe
wasn’t going to be disagreeable about it.</p>

<p>Phillipsburg came and went, defeated easily
enough, 12 points to 3, and Warne High School
followed a week later. High School always put
up a good fight against Parkinson, and she made
no exception this year. Coach Driscoll used many
substitutes that afternoon and so High School
found her work easier. Myron had his baptism by
fire in the second period and lasted until the end
of the third. He was taken out then because High
School had tied the score and it was necessary
to add another touchdown or field-goal to the home
team’s side of the ledger. So Kearns, who was
still the most dependable full-back in sight, took
Myron’s place. Kearns gained and lost in his
usual way, and had no great part in the securing
of the third Parkinson score. Katie was mainly
responsible for that, for he sneaked away from
the opponent’s thirty-two yards and landed the
ball on her eight, from whence it was carried over
on the fourth down by Brounker. That made the
figures 20 to 14, and there they remained for the
rest of the contest.</p>

<p>Myron was huffy about being removed and
every one who spoke to him discovered the fact.
Of course, he was huffy in a perfectly gentlemanly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
way. He didn’t scold and he didn’t sneer, but he
indulged in irony and intimated that if football
affairs continued to be managed as they had been
that afternoon he would refuse to be held responsible
if the season ended in defeat. Oddly enough,
no one appeared panic-stricken at the veiled
threat. Joe grinned, until Myron looked haughty
and insulted, and then became grave and spoke
his mind. He had an annoying way of doing that,
to Myron’s way of thinking.</p>

<p>“Kiddo,” said Joe, on this occasion, “if I was
you I’d let Driscoll and Mellen run things their
own way. Maybe their way don’t always look good
to you, but you aren’t in possession of all the&mdash;the
facts, so to speak. When they put in Kearns
today they had a reason, believe me, Brother. You
attend to your knitting and let theirs alone. If
they drop a stitch, it’s their funeral, not yours.
You’ve got just about all you can do to beat
Kearns and Williams for full-back’s position&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m ahead of Williams right now,” said Myron
with asperity.</p>

<p>“All right, kiddo; you stay there. Don’t get
highfaluting and swell-headed. Just as soon as
you do you’ll quit playing your best and Williams’ll
slip past you. Take an old man’s advice,
Brother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wish you’d stop that ‘Brother,’” said Myron
pettishly. “I’m not your brother. And I’m not
swell-headed, either. And I don’t try to tell
Driscoll how to run the team. Only, when I know
my own&mdash;my own capabilities I naturally think
something’s sort of funny when things happen like
what happened today!”</p>

<p>“Lots of funny things happen that we can’t
account for in this world,” remarked Joe philosophically
as he bent over his book again. “Best
thing to do is let ’em happen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, rats!” muttered the other.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Myron began to have
fallings-out with Old Addie. Old Addie&mdash;he
wasn’t phenomenally old, by any means, but he
seemed old in a faculty composed of young or
youngish men&mdash;was well-liked, and kindly and just
to a fault. But he had views on the importance of
Greek and Latin not held by all members of his
classes. He believed that Herodotus was the
greatest man who ever lived and Horace the greatest
poet, and held that an acquaintance with the
writings of these and other departed masters was
an essential part of every person’s education.
Many disagreed with him. Those who disagreed
and kept the fact to themselves got on very nicely.
Those who were so misguided as to disagree and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
say so earned his pitying contempt; although contempt
is perhaps too strong a word. Myron in a
rash moment confessed that Latin didn’t interest
him. He had to think up on the spur of the
moment some plausible excuse for being illy prepared,
and that excuse seemed handy. The result
was unfortunate. There was a meeting in Mr. Addicks’
study in the evening, a meeting that lasted
for an hour and a quarter and that included readings
from the Latin poets, essayists and historians,
sometimes in translation, more often in the
original. Myron, bored to tears, at last capitulated.
He owned that Latin was indeed a beautiful
language, that Livy was a wonder, Cicero a
peach and Horace a corker. He didn’t use just
those terms, but that’s a detail. Mr. Addicks,
suspicious of the sudden conversion, pledged him
to a reformation in the matter of study and freed
him.</p>

<p>But the conversion was not real and Old Addie
soon developed a most embarrassing habit of calling
on Myron in class. Myron called it “picking
on me.” Whatever it was called, it usually resulted
disastrously to Myron’s pretences of having
studied in the manner agreed on. Old Addie
waxed sarcastic, Myron assumed a haughty, contemptuous
air. They became antagonistic and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
trouble brewed. Myron didn’t have enough time
to do justice to all his courses, he declared to Joe,
and since Latin was the least liked and the most
troublesome it was Latin that suffered. There
is no doubt that two and a half hours&mdash;often more&mdash;of
football leaves a chap more inclined for bed
than study. Not infrequently Myron went to sleep
with his head on a book and had to be forcibly
wrested from slumber by Joe at ten o’clock or
thereabouts. So matters stood at the end of
Myron’s first fortnight of what might be called intensive
football training. So, in fact, they continued
to stand, with slight changes, to the morning
of the day on which Parkinson played Day and
Robins School.</p>

<p>The team was to travel away from home for
that contest and Myron was to go with it, not as
a spectator, but as a useful member of the force.
He did not go, however. At chapel his name was
among a list of seven others recited by the Principal,
and at eleven he was admitted to the inner
sanctum, behind the room in which he had, a month
and a half ago, held converse with Mr. Morgan.
This time it was “Jud” himself who received
him. The Principal’s real name was Judson, but
at some earlier time in his incumbency of the
office he had been dubbed Jud, and in spite of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
possible likelihood of getting him confused with
the captain of the football team, he was still so
called. Doctor Lane taught English, but his
courses were advanced and Myron had not reached
them. In consequence he knew very little of Jud;
much less than Jud knew of him; and he felt a
certain amount of awe as he took the indicated
chair at the left of the big mahogany desk. The
Doctor didn’t beat about the bush any to speak of.
He advanced at once to the matter in hand, which
appeared to be: Why wasn’t Myron keeping up
in Latin?</p>

<p>Myron said he thought it must be because he
didn’t have time enough to study it. He said it
was his firm belief that he was taking too many
courses. He thought that it would be better if he
was allowed to drop one course, preferably Latin,
until the next term. Doctor Lane smiled wanly
and wanted to know if Myron was quite sure that
he was making the most of what time he had.
Myron said he thought he was. He didn’t say it
very convincedly, however. Doctor Lane inquired
how much time each day was devoted to Latin.
Myron didn’t seem to have a very clear impression;
perhaps, though, an hour. Jud delved into
the boy’s daily life and elicited the fact that something
like two and a half hours were devoted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
learning to play full-back and something less than
three to learning his lessons. Presented as Jud
presented it, the fact didn’t look attractive even to
Myron. He felt dimly that something was wrong.
He attempted to better his statement by explaining
that very often he studied between hours&mdash;a
little. Doctor Lane was not impressed. He twiddled
a card that appeared to hold a record of
Myron’s scholastic career for a moment and then
pronounced a verdict.</p>

<p>“Foster, as I diagnose your case, you are too
much interested in football and not sufficiently
in your studies. Also, football is claiming too
much of your time. Football is a splendid game
and a beneficent form of exercise, but it is not the&mdash;what
I may call the chief industry here, Foster.
We try to do other things besides play football.
Perhaps you have lost sight of that fact.”</p>

<p>Jud let that sink in for a moment and returned
the card to its place in an indexed cabinet, closing
the drawer with a decisive <em>bang</em> that made Myron
jump.</p>

<p>“So,” continued the Principal drily, “I think
it will be best if you detach yourself from football
interests for&mdash;for awhile, Foster.”</p>

<p>Silence ensued. Myron gulped. Then he asked
in a small voice: “How long, sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, we won’t decide that now.” Jud’s voice
and manner struck Myron as being far too bright
and flippant. “We’ll see how it works out. I’ve
known it to work very nicely in many cases. I
shall expect to hear better&mdash;much better&mdash;accounts
of you from Mr. Addicks, Foster. Good morning.”</p>

<p>And that is why Myron didn’t go bowling off
to the station with the rest of the team, and why
Kearns and Houghton played the full-back position
that afternoon, and why, after a miserable
six hours spent in mooning about a deserted
campus and a lonely room, Myron packed a suit-case
with a few of his yellow-hued shirts and similar
necessities and unobtrusively made his way to
Maple Street in the early gloom of the October
evening.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>ANDY TAKES A JOURNEY</small></h2>


<p>At a few minutes past eight that evening Joe
clattered hurriedly up the stairs of the house in
Mill Street and thumped imperatively at Andrew’s
door. Just why he thumped didn’t appear, since
he threw the door open without waiting for permission.
Andrew looked up inquiringly from his
book in the yellow radius of light around the
table.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he greeted. “Slide under the bed
and maybe they won’t find you.”</p>

<p>“It’s that idiot, Myron,” announced Joe breathlessly,
and sank into a chair.</p>

<p>“What’s he done now?” asked Andrew interestedly.</p>

<p>“Bolted!”</p>

<p>“Bolted?”</p>

<p>“Beat it&mdash;vamoosed&mdash;lit out&mdash;gone!”</p>

<p>“Where? What for?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know where, but he’s gone. I suppose
he’s headed home. He’s in wrong at the
Office over Latin, and this morning Doc Lane told
him to quit football. He was to have gone along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
with us to play Day and Robins, you know, and
was all keyed up about it. I didn’t get many of
the details: only saw him for about three minutes
just before we left: but he was talking then about
firing himself and hiring out to Kenwood for the
rest of the year.”</p>

<p>Andrew frowned. “A sweet thought,” he murmured
sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Oh, he wouldn’t do it,” said Joe. “He likes
to talk like that, but he’s all right behind his
mouth.”</p>

<p>“I hope so. Where&mdash;when did he go?”</p>

<p>“Search me. I know he was gone when I got
back at six, or a little before. I thought, of course,
that he was around somewhere; probably at
Alumni. But he wasn’t at dinner and he didn’t
show up afterwards, and I remembered his line
of talk this morning and got to snooping around
and found his suit-case gone and some of his
things; brushes and sponge and the like of those.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he got leave to go home over Sunday.”</p>

<p>“I thought of that and found out from Mr.
Hoyt. Had to be careful so he wouldn’t get suspicious,
but I got away with it, I guess. He hasn’t
asked for leave; and wouldn’t have got it anyway,
I guess. No, he’s just plain beat it.”</p>

<p>Andrew whistled softly and expressively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“That fixes him,” he said regretfully. “On top
of probation&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s the point,” urged Joe. “He’s dished
for fair if faculty gets wind of it. That’s why
I came. <em>I</em> can’t go. I asked Driscoll and he said
nothing doing. So it’s up to you, Andy.”</p>

<p>“Up to me? Go? Where?”</p>

<p>“Go after him and bring him back,” answered
Joe. “I looked up trains. He probably waited
until after dark, because he wouldn’t have risked
being seen with a suit-case, and if he did he must
have taken the six-eighteen for New York.
There’s no train for Port Foster out of Philadelphia
until seven-twelve tomorrow morning. He
might stay in New York overnight or go on to
Philadelphia, so the best way’ll be to go right
through to Philadelphia and watch the Port Foster
trains.”</p>

<p>Andrew stared amazedly. “Look here, Joe,”
he said, “are you suggesting that I go to Philadelphia
after Myron?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” answered Joe impatiently. “What
did you suppose? And you’ll have to get a hustle
on, too: it’s about eight-fifteen now and your
train goes at nine-five. I’d go in a minute, but I’m
in training and the rule’s strict, and if I got
caught&mdash;fare thee well!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>To Joe’s surprise, Andrew began to laugh.
“Well, you’re a wonder, Joe,” he gasped. “Why,
man alive, I can’t go traipsing all over the United
States like that! I’m beastly sorry for Myron,
but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why can’t you?” demanded Joe, scowling.
“Some one’s got to, and that’s flat. If he’s
caught away from school without permission
they’ll chuck him as sure as shooting. Why do
you say you can’t go, Andy?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why, for one reason, I can’t afford it,
you idiot! How much do you think it’ll cost to
go to Philadelphia and back? I’m no millionaire!
Why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I thought of that.” Joe pulled a roll of bills
from his trousers pocket and flung it on the table.
“There’s twenty-five, all I have right now. It’s
enough, I guess.”</p>

<p>Andrew stared at the money in surprise.
“Well&mdash;but&mdash;look here, I’ve got an engagement
in the morning. And how do you know I can get
leave?”</p>

<p>“Take it! No one’ll know you’re away,” said
Joe. “Gosh, we’ve got to risk something!”</p>

<p>“<em>We</em> have? You mean <em>I</em> have, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s the difference? Myron’s a friend,
ain’t he, and we can’t let him go and kill himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
off like this without making a try, can we? Besides,
the team needs him bad. If he’d hung on a
bit longer he’d have been full-back and&mdash;and
everything! I&mdash;I’d like to wring his silly
neck!”</p>

<p>Andrew smiled. Then he stared thoughtfully
at the table. At last he seized the roll of money,
thrust it in his pocket and pushed back his chair.
“Guess you’re right, Joe,” he said. “What time
did you say the train goes?”</p>

<p>“Nine-five.” Joe jerked out his watch.
“You’ve got forty minutes. Better pack a toothbrush
and a night-shirt, kiddo.”</p>

<p>“Pack nothing,” replied Andrew. “A toothbrush
and a comb will see me through, and those
go in my pocket. I want that brown book, though,
and some sheets of paper. Better have my fountain
pen, too. You’ll have to take a message to Wynant,
29 Williams, for me, Joe. Better do it tonight.
Tell him I’m called away and can’t be around in
the morning. I’ll see him when I get back. Now,
what about the dogs? Mind coming around in the
morning and letting them out and feeding them?
Good! We’re off, then.”</p>

<p>Andrew turned out the light and they fumbled
their way to the door. Outside, Andrew gave the
key to Joe. “Don’t forget the dogs, Joe,” he reminded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
“Now, then, tell me again about these
trains. It’s Philadelphia I’m going to, is it?”</p>

<p>Joe explained carefully as they hurried through
the illy-lighted streets toward the station. “Better
get to Philadelphia by the first train you can
make, Andy. You can sleep on the way, some.
The first Sunday train for Port Foster leaves
Philadelphia at twelve minutes past seven. There
isn’t another until ten-something. He may wait
for that. You’ll have to watch for him on the platform.
For the love of mud, Andy, don’t miss
him!”</p>

<p>“I won’t!” answered the other grimly as they
entered the station. “Wait here a minute. I’m
going to call up the Office.”</p>

<p>“The Office!” exclaimed Joe aghast. “What
for?”</p>

<p>“To get permission.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know. I won’t. Here, you buy the ticket.
Get it to Philadelphia and return if you can. I’ll
be right with you.”</p>

<p>Andrew was as good as his word. Joe viewed
him anxiously. “Did you get it?” he asked.</p>

<p>Andrew nodded. “Yes. I told Mr. Hoyt I had
to be away overnight on important matters. He
hemmed a bit at first, but finally came around.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
So that’s all right. I feel rather better for having
faculty’s blessing, Joe.” Ten minutes later
the long train rolled in and Andrew climbed
aboard. He was going into a day coach, but Joe
pulled him back and hurried him down the platform,
past a hundred lighted windows and hustled
him into a parlour-car. “Might as well be as comfortable
as you can,” he explained. “You can
get a pretty fair nap in one of those chairs if you
don’t mind waking up with a broken neck! Good-bye
and good luck, Andy!”</p>

<p>“Good-bye. See you tomorrow afternoon or
evening. Don’t forget Tess and the puppies!”</p>

<p>Then the train pulled out and Joe heaved a
sigh of relief and made his way back to the campus
and Williams Hall and the indignant Mr.
Wynant.</p>

<p>About the same time Coach Driscoll and Captain
Mellen were talking things over in the
former’s lodgings. Parkinson had played smooth,
hard football that afternoon, bringing encouragement
to both, and their countenances still reflected
satisfaction. “Looks as though we had struck
our gait at last, Cap,” said Mr. Driscoll, puffing
comfortably at his pipe.</p>

<p>“It does look so,” agreed Jud. “It’s time, too,
with only two more games before Kenwood.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I’d rather see a team come slowly and
not reach the peak too early in the season. I’m
more afraid of slumps than the smallpox, Mellen.
Remember year before last’s experience?”</p>

<p>Jud nodded. “If we can hold it where it is,
Coach, we’ll be all right, I guess. Some of the
fellows certainly played themselves proud today:
Keith and Meldrum and Norris&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And Mellen,” suggested Mr. Driscoll, smiling
through the smoke.</p>

<p>“I guess I didn’t do so badly,” Jud allowed.
“But that Dobbins was the corker, when you
come right down to brass tacks, don’t you think
so?”</p>

<p>“Dobbins played as remarkable a game as I’ve
seen in a long, long time,” was the reply. “The
way he opened holes in the D. and R. line was
pretty. They weren’t holes, either, they were&mdash;were
nice, broad boulevards! A stick of dynamite
wouldn’t have made more of a mess of their
centre!”</p>

<p>“And he’s all there on defence, too,” said Jud.
“Steady as a concrete wall. He and Keith work
like twins.”</p>

<p>“Pretty,” agreed Mr. Driscoll. “I guess
there’s no question as to who’ll play right guard
against Kenwood. I wish, though, I knew who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
was going to play full-back.” Mr. Driscoll
frowned. “You’re sure Foster’s out of it?”</p>

<p>“Fairly. I only know what you know. I
haven’t seen him. I’m not surprised, though. He
was beginning to show a good deal of side and you
know yourself that when a fellow gets his head
swelled he comes a cropper one way or
another.”</p>

<p>“I know. Still, we mustn’t be too hard on the
boy, for we’ve paid him a good deal of attention
and that’s likely to turn a chap’s head unless it’s
screwed on pretty tightly. And we’ve worked him
hard, too. Maybe he hasn’t had time to do enough
studying.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s out of it, anyway. It’s hard luck,
for I thought he was coming along finely. I guess
it will have to be Kearns, after all.”</p>

<p>The coach nodded. “I haven’t lost hope of
Kearns yet, Cap. He’s got it in him to play good
football. I was wondering, though, if we could
spare Brounker for the position. He’s a good
half, but we may not need him there, and perhaps
with some coaching between now and three weeks
from now he’d be better than Kearns.”</p>

<p>“I suppose there’s a chance of Foster getting
clear before the Kenwood game,” said Jud doubtfully,
“but he wouldn’t be much use to us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mighty little,” replied the coach. “Of course,
if he was off only a week it would be different. In
that case we could take him back and have him
handy in case Kearns went bad. But I don’t
know&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I guess I’d better see him in the morning and
find out what the prospects are. If he will saw
wood and get rid of his conditions, or whatever
his trouble is, by a week from Monday&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, tell him that. Brow-beat him a bit. Get
him on his mettle. I’ll see him, if you think it
would be better.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take a fall out of him first,” said Jud.
“By the way, he and Dobbins room together. It
might be a good scheme to get Dobbins after him.
I guess they’re pretty close from what I hear,
and maybe he’d listen to Dobbins when he
wouldn’t to me. Well, anyway, I think we can
lick Kenwood this year even without a full-back,”
he ended.</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll smiled and shook his head. “Let’s
not be too sure, Mellen,” he said. “Wait until the
Sunday papers come. Six to six sounds pretty
good for Phillipsburg, but we don’t know yet
how many of her subs Kenwood used. That coach
of hers is a foxy chap, and it may be that he
was satisfied to get away with a tie and leave us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
guessing. Perhaps he thought we had scouts
over there today, looking them over.”</p>

<p>“I sort of wish we had had,” said Jud. “Oh,
I know your idea on the subject, Coach, and I’m
not saying you aren’t right, but, just the same,
it’s a handicap. Kenwood sends fellows to watch
our playing and gets lots of useful information,
I’ll bet, and we have to depend on what the papers
tell us. And most of that guff is written by fellows
friendly to Kenwood. If the Kenwood coach
wants the news to go out that the team is rotten,
it goes out, and we have to swallow it. I’d give
a hundred dollars to see her play Montrose next
Saturday!”</p>

<p>“That’s high pay for acting the spy,” replied
the coach gravely. “See here, Jud Mellen, you’re
a fair and square, decent sort, from all I’ve seen
of you, and I’ve known you for three years. You
wouldn’t pick a pocket or lie, and I’ve never yet
seen you doing any dirty work in a game. Then
just how would you explain it to your conscience
if you went over to Kenwood next Saturday with
the idea of seeing how much information you could
get hold of regarding Kenwood’s plays and signals
and so on?”</p>

<p>“But, gosh ding it, Mr. Driscoll, I wouldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
wear a false moustache and all that! I wouldn’t
sneak in, I’d go openly. There’s no reason why
I shouldn’t see Kenwood play a game of football
just because I happen to play with Parkinson!”</p>

<p>“Not if just being entertained was what you
were there for, Cap,” answered the other. “But
it wouldn’t be. You’d be a spy, and you know
it, old son. That’s what I object to. When the
time comes that it is an understood and mutually
agreed on thing that members of one football team
are welcome to see another team play, why, then
I won’t make a yip. But you know how we love
to get word here from the gate that a Kenwood
scout has gone in! We cut out new plays and try
to look worse than we are.”</p>

<p>“You mean we would if you’d let us,” laughed
Jud.</p>

<p>“You do it, anyhow,” said the coach, smiling.
“I’ve watched you too often. The last time we
had visitors I asked Cater why he didn’t use a
certain play in front of the other fellow’s goal
and get a score and he looked innocent and said
he’d forgot it. No, we’ll get along without that
sort of stuff, Mellen, while I’m here. I don’t like
it a bit.”</p>

<p>“Well, I said you were right,” Jud laughed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
“I just had to have my little kick. Hello, nearly
ten! I must leg it. I’ll see Foster in the morning;
Dobbins, too; and let you know what I learn.
Good night, Coach.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>AN EARLY MORNING CALL</small></h2>


<p>But Jud didn’t see Myron in the morning, for the
reason that we know of. Only Joe was in Number
17 when the football captain knocked, and Joe was
not telling all he knew. According to him, Foster
was “out just now” and the time of his return
was most uncertain. Joe “had an idea” that his
friend was dining away from school. Jud said
that it didn’t matter much and that he’d see
Foster later. Then:</p>

<p>“Maybe you know how bad he’s fixed with the
Office, Whoa?” he suggested.</p>

<p>“I don’t,” replied Joe, “for he hasn’t said
much to me about it. I know that it’s Latin that’s
troubling him, though. He’s been in wrong with
Addicks for a couple of weeks. Fact is, Cap, Myron
hasn’t been putting in enough time on study. He
falls to sleep at the table there about every other
night. Guess he’s been getting a bit too much
exercise.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ve worked him pretty steadily. Too
bad, for, between you and me, he was doing mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
well and looked awfully good. I wonder if you
can’t find out what the prospects are, Whoa, and
let me know. If he could get a clean slate by a
week from Monday, say, he might still be of some
use to the team. He probably wouldn’t start the
Kenwood game, but it’s a fair bet he’d get in for
part of it. Driscoll and I were talking about him
last night, and I said I thought that maybe you
could sort of jack him up; make him see that it
is up to him to get square with the Office and get
back to the team.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll get him back if it can be done,” Joe
assured him. “I was going to, anyway. We need
him, Cap.”</p>

<p>“We certainly do, Whoa. See what you can
do with him. Wouldn’t some tutoring help?
There’s a chap named Merriman in town who’s a
regular whale at it.”</p>

<p>“I know him. I’ll have a talk with Myron
when he comes back&mdash;in, I mean&mdash;and let you
know, Cap. You leave him to me!”</p>

<p>Jud Mellen had no more than got out of the
building when a fearsome knock came at the
door and Chas Cummins appeared, scowling ferociously.
“Hello,” he said. “Where’s Foster?”</p>

<p>“Out just now,” replied Joe affably. “Want
to leave a message?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“No&mdash;yes&mdash;Yes, tell him I say he’s to beat
it over to my room the minute he shows up
here!”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Joe.</p>

<p>Chas clung to the doorknob and continued to
scowl, and studied Joe speculatively. Finally:
“Isn’t it a mess?” he demanded. “Everything
going like clock-work, and then, bingo&mdash;Officer, call
the ambulance! Honest, Whoa, I could kick
Foster from here to New York and back cheerfully,
drat his hide!”</p>

<p>“I wish you could kick him back,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Close the door, will you? Thanks. Can you
keep a secret, Chas?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes. Go on. What’s up?”</p>

<p>“Myron’s gone. Went last evening.”</p>

<p>“<em>Fired?</em>”</p>

<p>“No, he just went.”</p>

<p>“Left school, you mean? Well, what&mdash;do you
know&mdash;about that?”</p>

<p>“We’re trying to get him back before faculty
gets on to it, but it doesn’t look good. Merriman’s
on his trail. Took the nine o’clock train last night.
I think he’ll manage to head him off all right, but
Myron’s a cranky, stubborn dog and may refuse
to come back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>“Any one suspect so far?” asked Chas with
knitted brows.</p>

<p>“Don’t think so. Good thing there’s no chapel
on Sunday, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Merry Andrew went, you say? Good stuff!
If any one can do the persuasion stunt, Andy can.
Hang the beggar, what’s he think, anyhow?
Doesn’t he know he will get fired if faculty hears
about it? And what about me?”</p>

<p>“You?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“Well, I mean the team,” corrected Chas hurriedly.
“He ought to be licked! I’d do it, too,
if it would do any good. Honest, Whoa, isn’t
this the very limit?”</p>

<p>“Way past it,” agreed Joe. “He’s a crazy
guy for sure.”</p>

<p>“When do you expect Andy back?” asked Chas
after a moment.</p>

<p>“He might make it by the five o’clock. Ought
to be here by eight, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Well, if he doesn’t fetch him it’ll be
good-bye to Foster for keeps! What’s wrong
with him, anyway? Some one said he was on
pro.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know whether it’s out and out probation
or not,” said Joe. “Didn’t have much time
to talk to him. But he said Doc Lane told him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
let football alone and get hunky with Addicks
again.”</p>

<p>“Latin, eh? I always said that language ought
to be prohibited! It’s always getting folks into
trouble. Well, I suppose there isn’t anything I
can do. I wish you’d let me know the news when
there is any, Whoa.”</p>

<p>“I will. Keep this quiet, though, Chas. You
and Andy and I are the only ones who know, and
it mustn’t get any further. I only told you because
you and Myron have some game on and I
knew you’d keep quiet.”</p>

<p>“Some game on? What makes you think
that?” asked Chas.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got eyes and ears,” answered the
other drily. “I’m not asking questions, though.
So long. I’ll let you know how it comes out.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget. If I’m out leave word with
Brown. Just say ‘Yes’ or ‘No.’ I’ll understand.
Gosh, I hope Andy fetches him, though!”</p>

<p>Myron reached New York at a few minutes after
ten on Saturday night. He had some supper on
the way, crushed into a corner of a crowded dining-car,
but he wasn’t hungry and ate little. On
arrival, quick work in a taxi-cab got him across
town in time for a train to Philadelphia that
landed him there just before midnight. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
a married cousin living in that city, but he preferred
to go to the quiet little hotel at which his
mother stayed when on shopping visits. He left
an order to be called at half-past six, luxuriated
in a bath and crawled wearily to bed. But sleep
was still a long way from him, and until after two
he lay there wide-eyed and thought and thought,
and twisted and turned.</p>

<p>There may be more dismal places in the world
than Philadelphia at six-thirty on a rainy morning.
If so, Myron had fortunately escaped them.
He had left himself barely enough time to dress
and reach the station for the seven-twelve express,
and when, aroused by the blatant <em>buz-z-zz</em> of the
telephone, he staggered to the window and looked
out, he felt that he never could do it. That drab,
empty stretch of wet street was the last blow to
waning courage. Had he rested well and felt
normally fresh he would have charged at his
clothes, leaped into a cab and made it nicely, but
he was in no condition of mind or body for such
hustling methods. Besides, there were later
trains, and he was in no hurry to face his folks,
and the tumbled bed looked awfully good to him.
Three minutes later he was asleep again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Andrew Merriman was slowly pacing
the platform beside the seven-twelve train.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
He had been there ever since the train had rolled
sleepily into the long, gloomy shed. Keeping tabs
on the passengers was no difficult task, for they
were few in number and moved with dragging feet.
Andrew had arrived in Philadelphia at half-past
five, after an interminable ride during which he
had huddled himself into a seat in a day-coach and
slumbered fitfully between stops. It had been a
glorious relief to leave that leisurely train and
stretch his legs again. He had had breakfast at
a nearby lunch-room, and now, all things considered,
was feeling very fit. A glance at his
watch showed the time to be two minutes to seven.
In fourteen minutes from now he would know his
fate. He had already arranged his plans in the
event that Myron didn’t show up for that train,
and he would have three hours in which to carry
them out. A portly man with two suit-cases waddled
down the long platform and puffed himself up
the steps of a car. Even allowing for a disguise,
thought Andrew whimsically, that was not Myron.
Nor was the next passenger, a fussy little man
with two small boys strung out behind him who
came so fast that Andrew half expected to see
him “snap the whip” any moment and send the
tiniest boy hurtling through space. But he didn’t.
He herded the children into a car and smiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
triumphantly at Andrew. Evidently, he considered
that arriving with only five minutes to
spare was a reckless proceeding. There were the
usual last-moment arrivals and then the train
reluctantly pulled out, leaving Andrew alone on
the platform.</p>

<p>Two blocks away was a hotel, and thither he
made his way. Capturing a telephone directory,
he found a chair by a window and turned to the
list of hotels. There was an appalling lot of them
and nothing to indicate which were of the sort
likely to be patronised by Myron. But he had
three hours before him and plenty of money, and
was not discouraged. He took a piece of paper
from a pocket, unscrewed his pen and set to work.
Ten minutes later he was ready. The lobby was
practically deserted and he had the telephone
booths to himself. When he had exhausted all the
nickels he had he crossed to the news-stand and
had a dollar bill changed. Then he went on with
his campaign. It was slow work, for many of the
hotels were extremely deliberate in answering.
The voices that came back to him sounded sleepy,
and some sounded cross as well.</p>

<p>“Is Myron Foster stopping there?” Andrew
would ask.</p>

<p>“Who? Fosdick? How do you spell it? Oh!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
What are the initials? Hold the line, please.”
Then, after a wait: “No such party registered.”</p>

<p>At any rate, that is the way it went for nearly
twenty minutes. Then luck turned.</p>

<p>Myron was still slumbering when the telephone
rang a second time. For a moment he stared at
the ceiling, a perfectly strange ceiling that seemed
to return his regard coldly, and strove to think
where he was. While he was still struggling the
impatient instrument on the table beside the bed
buzzed again. Myron reached for it and recollection
came to him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said sleepily. “Hello!”</p>

<p>“Gentleman to see you, Mr. Foster. Shall we
send him up?”</p>

<p>“Gentleman to see me!” echoed Myron. Was it
possible that his father had learned already of
his departure from school and had come up from
Port Foster? He was thoroughly awake now.
“What is the name?” he asked. After a moment
of silence: “Merriman,” said the voice at the
other end. “Merriman?” thought Myron. “I
don’t know any Merriman! Except Andy. Who
the dickens&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear, Mr. Foster,” said the clerk
politely.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;er&mdash;all right! Ask him to come up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
please.” Myron put the receiver down, unlocked
the door and returned to bed to hug his knees and
stare perplexedly at the footboard. Who the
dickens was Merriman? Of course it couldn’t be
Andy. This was Philadelphia, and Andy was
several hundred miles away. Well, he would soon
know! Then came a tap at the door and Myron
said “Come in” in an unnecessarily loud tone
and the portal opened. Then it closed again. And
Myron, with eyes that looked as big and as round
as butter-chips, whispered: “<em>Where’d you come
from?</em>”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>MYRON COMES BACK</small></h2>


<p>“Afraid I’ve spoiled your beauty sleep, Myron,”
said the visitor. “Sorry, but I’ve been up so long
I forgot how early it was.”</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what are you doing over here?” gasped
Myron.</p>

<p>“Looking for you, of course,” replied Andrew
easily as he seated himself on the bed. “Nice
quarters you’ve got. Next time, though, I wish
you’d locate further up on the alphabet. It’s a
long way to the M’s!”</p>

<p>“Are you crazy or&mdash;or am I?” asked Myron
helplessly.</p>

<p>“Neither, I hope,” answered the visitor calmly.
“You see, I set out to find you on the telephone
and had to call up about twenty hotels before I
got the right one. I started with the A’s and you,
as it happened, were among the M’s.”</p>

<p>“What did you want to find me for? Who sent
you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose you might say that Joe sent
me. At least, he had the idea first. After that,
I sort of sent myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“You might have spared yourself the trouble,”
said Myron defiantly. “I’m not going
back!”</p>

<p>Apparently Andrew didn’t hear that. “Joe was
all fussed up, like a hen who’s hatched out a duck.
He came around about half-past eight and loaded
me with money and handed me my hat, so to
speak. Got in here around five-thirty. You didn’t
show up at the station for the seven-twelve, so I
changed my money into nickels and proceeded to
make the telephone company enormously wealthy.
You’ve cost me&mdash;or, rather, Joe&mdash;a lot of money,
Myron.” Andrew shook his head sadly. “And
I’m not sure you’re worth it, either.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t ask him to spend money on me,” said
Myron sulkily. “He hadn’t any business butting
in, anyway. It’s my own affair. If I want to
leave school I’ve got a right to, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Back up! Who told you that?”</p>

<p>“Told me what?” asked Myron blankly.</p>

<p>“That you had a right to leave school.”</p>

<p>“Why, no one told me! But it’s so!”</p>

<p>“No, sir, it isn’t,” said Andrew emphatically.
“You haven’t any more right to leave school than
a soldier has to leave his post, or a policeman
his beat. Not a bit more, Myron.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t so,” answered the other excitedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
“It isn’t the same at all. Duty is one thing and&mdash;and
staying where you don’t get a square deal’s
another. My folks have a right to take me away
from Parkinson whenever they want to!”</p>

<p>“Have they taken you out?”</p>

<p>“No, they don’t know yet. But they will when
I ask them to.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, then. What your folks do is
another matter, old man. It’s what you do that
I’m talking about. Why do you say you haven’t
had a square deal?”</p>

<p>“Because I haven’t! Look at what Jud did
to me! First of all, they made me take too many
courses, courses I didn’t want to take at all, some
of them. Then when I couldn’t keep them up just
as&mdash;just as they think I ought to, they came down
on me! Jud says I can’t play football. Just because
Addicks has it in for me. Addicks calls on
me twice as often as any other fellow in class. I
hate Latin, anyway. I didn’t want to take it this
year. Next year would be time enough. Driscoll
made me work like a slave, and I didn’t have time
enough for all the things I’m supposed to study,
and Jud socked it to me. I’d been trying for a
month to get on the team, and now, just when I
was sure of a place, Jud springs this! Call that
a square deal? I don’t!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, it’s sort of tough luck, old man. How
long are you off for?”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t tell me. Said we’d wait and see,
or something. He can wait. I’m through.”</p>

<p>“Still, I don’t see how you’re helping things
much by running away,” said Andrew mildly.
“If you want to play on the team you’ll have to do
it by mail, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m done wanting to,” answered Myron
roughly. “I’m done with the whole rotten place.”</p>

<p>“And Joe and me? I see.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say I had anything against you and
Joe,” retorted Myron indignantly. “Or&mdash;or
some other fellows. The fellows are all right. It&mdash;it’s
the school. The way they do things. They
don’t give you a chance. They aren’t fair.”</p>

<p>“So you even up by not being fair, too?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” asked Myron,
glowering.</p>

<p>“Why, you get mad because you think faculty
has treated you badly, and then you turn around
and treat other folks badly.”</p>

<p>“What other folks?” asked Myron.</p>

<p>“Your friends, the football team and, through
that, the whole school.”</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?” Myron demanded,
frowning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, take Joe and me, for instance. We’re
in the picture. You let us take a liking to you,
which we wouldn’t have done if we hadn’t thought
you a good, square sort, the sort that does his
duty even if it looks hard. Then when duty gets a
bit tiresome you kick us in the shins and run away.
Same way with the team. You went out for it and
the coach and the rest spent time and effort on
you. They thought you were a square sort, too.
They wouldn’t knowingly make a poor investment
any more than Joe and I would. Then, when you
hit a snag, you repudiate your debt to them and
beat it. You had a chance to make a good player
of yourself and win a position on the team and help
bring about a victory for the school. Because you
get mad with Jud, you tell the school to go to the
dickens. In other words, Myron, old man, you’re
a quitter.”</p>

<p>“I’m not!” cried the other desperately.
“You’re making it out all wrong! Besides, it
wouldn’t make any difference to the school if I
stayed. I’m out of football.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see it. You’re out of football until
you get back your class standing. The right thing
to do is to get it back as soon as you can. It’s
your fault that you lost it. There’s no use kidding
yourself, Myron. You got in trouble with Addicks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
because you didn’t play fair with him. You got
in trouble with Jud for the same reason. Now you
won’t play fair with the rest of us. Think it
over.”</p>

<p>“It’s not so, Andy! I tell you I didn’t have
time to study that beastly Latin! Joe knows I
didn’t. I was too tired at night. I couldn’t!”</p>

<p>“If that’s really so you should have told Driscoll
to let up on you. But I think the trouble was
that you didn’t make the best use of the time
you had. You have two hours every morning, to
my certain knowledge, when you’ve no classes,
and I’ve never heard of you making use of them
for study.”</p>

<p>“It’s all well enough for you to preach,” retorted
Myron bitterly. “You <em>like</em> the wretched
stuff! You don’t have any trouble with it. I do.
I&mdash;even if I went back I’d never catch up in
class.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you would. I’ll guarantee that. I’ll
promise you that you’ll be in good standing with
Addicks by next Saturday.”</p>

<p>Myron stared, surprised, doubtful. “How?”
he asked at length.</p>

<p>“I’ll look after the ‘how,’ old man.”</p>

<p>“You mean you’ll tutor me again?”</p>

<p>Andrew nodded. Myron dropped his gaze to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the counterpane. A minute of silence followed
during which the ticking of Myron’s watch on the
bedside table sounded loudly in the room. Then
said Andrew briskly: “There’s a New York train
at ten, I think. That’ll give you time for breakfast
and let us catch the one-something back. You
get your bath and dress and I’ll go down and buy
a paper. Don’t know but what I’ll have a bite
more myself. My breakfast was a trifle sketchy.
How long will you be?”</p>

<p>Myron continued to study the counterpane.
Another silence ensued. Finally, though, it was
broken by Myron. “Twenty minutes,” he said
in a low voice.</p>

<p>It was dark when they stepped off the train at
Warne. As they did so a form detached itself
from the lamp-lit gloom of the platform and a
voice asked cautiously: “That you, Andy?”
Then Myron felt a hand tugging at his suit-case,
and: “Let me have it, kiddo,” said Joe. “We’ll
go over to Andy’s and leave it there until tomorrow.
Better not take any risks.”</p>

<p>They skirted the end of the train, avoiding publicity
as much as was possible, and made their
way toward Mill Street. Only when they were a
block from the track was the silence broken again.
Then Andy asked: “Everything all right, Joe?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think so. But I’m sure glad you didn’t leave
it until the next train. I’d have had nervous
prostration long before that! I had the dogs out
three times and fed them. There wasn’t anything
else to do. Maybe they’ve bust themselves
eating, but it can’t be helped. That kid over
in Williams&mdash;Wynant or something&mdash;has a grouch
a mile long, Andy. You’ll have to kiss him, I
guess, before he will ever smile again! How are
you, kiddo?”</p>

<p>“All right, thanks,” answered Myron rather
constrainedly.</p>

<p>“That’s good. By the way, I had to give the
impression that you were having dinner out somewhere.
So if any one mentions it you’d better play
up.”</p>

<p>“Who did you tell?” asked Myron.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I exactly <em>told</em> any one, but I let
Jud Mellen go away with the idea.”</p>

<p>“Was he looking for me?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, wanted you to hurry up and get back
to work,” replied Joe carelessly. “I told him that
if you weren’t back inside a week I’d bust every
bone in your body.”</p>

<p>“He will be,” said Andrew grimly. “If he
isn’t you may bust mine!”</p>

<p>Just before supper time Joe beat a tattoo on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the portal of Number 16 Goss. Chas Cummins’
voice bade him enter. Joe, however, only stuck his
head into the room, and, nodding to Brown, said
in a deep, mysterious whisper: “<em>Yes-s-s!</em>” Then
he closed the door and went off down the corridor,
chuckling. In Number 16, Brown raised his brows
and looked inquiringly at his chum.</p>

<p>“Batty?” he asked.</p>

<p>A day passed before Joe and Myron breathed
freely. By Monday evening it seemed quite safe
to assume that Myron’s absence had passed undetected.
They went across town and brought the
suit-case home then, Joe, however, transferring
certain articles, such as Myron’s pyjamas, to his
pockets in case some inquisitive member of the
faculty should insist on looking inside the bag.
But none challenged and the suit-case went back
to the closet and Myron’s toilet articles to their
places, and the episode was closed. The two
spoke of it but briefly. That was Sunday night,
as they were preparing for bed. Then Joe remarked
conversationally: “You’re a crazy loon,
kiddo, aren’t you?” After a moment of reflection
Myron said “Yes,” quite humbly.</p>

<p>“Sure are,” agreed Joe, tossing his trousers in
the general direction of a chair. “Any time any
guy accuses you of having sense, you knock him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
down. I’ll stand by you. Still, you have your
uses, and I’m glad to see you in our midst again.
How about being here, now that you are!”</p>

<p>“Tickled to death,” owned Myron a bit shamefacedly.</p>

<p>Joe chuckled. “Knew you would be,” he said.
“We ain’t&mdash;aren’t such a bad lot when you take
us, right. Good night, kiddo.”</p>

<p>“Good night, Joe. I&mdash;you&mdash;I mean, thanks!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>REINSTATED</small></h2>


<p>Myron isn’t likely to forget for a long time the
week that followed. Every afternoon at four
o’clock appeared Andrew, armed for the fray, and
for two hours of a hundred and twenty minutes
each Myron wrestled with Latin. Andrew was
merciless. From the stroke of four to the stroke
of six was the inexorable rule. Myron’s pleas
weren’t even heard. After two days he got fairly
used to it, though, and then the labour began to
bear fruit. Mr. Addicks shot a keen and questioning
glance at Myron on Wednesday and followed
it with one of mild approval on Thursday. Saturday
morning Myron was again out of the woods,
although, as Andrew reminded him more than
once, whether he stayed so depended on whether
he was willing to study hard and long and resolutely.
Myron reached the conclusion that he was.</p>

<p>But being out of the woods did not necessarily
place him in the full sunlight of faculty favour,
and so it was from the grandstand that he saw
Parkinson play Chancellor School at Mt. Wansett,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
and not from the players’ bench. Myron had
doubts as to his right to make the trip, and put the
matter up to Joe. Joe did not observe, as he might
have, that, having got as far away as Philadelphia
without leave, going to a not distant town under
like conditions shouldn’t worry Myron! Instead,
he advised him to put the question up to Mr. Hoyt.
The secretary referred to a mysterious book and
shook his head. “I can’t find that you have gone
on probation, Foster,” he said. “Nothing here
indicates it. You say Doctor Lane forbade you to
play football? Was anything said about probation?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I only thought&mdash;was afraid&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, I should say there was no intention,
then. If I were you I’d assume that I was not
on probation. However, if you still have doubts
I’ll take the matter up with the Principal as soon
as he’s at leisure, and if you’ll drop in again about
twelve&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But the train goes at eleven, sir!”
Mr. Hoyt smiled faintly. “In that case, Foster,
I don’t see how you can be here at twelve.”</p>

<p>“You think, then, that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>Myron hurried out before the secretary had
time to change his mind and think differently!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>It rained that day, and the game was played in
a sea of water on a soft and slippery turf. Many
boys who had meant to accompany the team backed
out when they viewed the weather, and only a
handful huddled in raincoats behind the Parkinson
bench and aided the Brown with damp enthusiasm.
Not that a great deal of cheering was
needed, however, for the first period settled the
outcome of the contest, and after that it was
merely a question of whether Chancellor would
score. Parkinson started with the line-up that,
so rumour had it, would face Kenwood two weeks
later: Stearns and Norris, ends; Mellen and Keith,
tackles; Cummins and Dobbins, guards; Cantrell,
centre; Cater, quarter; Meldrum and Brown,
halves; Kearns, full. But that arrangement did
not outlast the second period. The third began
with the score 19 to 0 and five substitutes on the
field. And during the subsequent thirty minutes
of playing time additional changes were frequent.
Parkinson ended with many third substitutes in
the line-up, to which may be fairly attributed the
fact that Chancellor saved her face at the last
and scored seven points.</p>

<p>With a slippery field and a wet ball, both teams
had stuck pretty closely to line plays, but some
five or six minutes from the end, Grove, playing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
quarter, took a chance and shot the ball to
Houghton, at full, for a wide run around left end.
Houghton muffed, not a difficult thing to do when
the ball is as slippery as a pat of butter and it
reaches you off at one side, and the fat was in
the fire. A defeated team is a dangerous team,
and Chancellor proved it then and there by piling
through the Parkinson first and second defences,
upsetting the distressed Houghton and salvaging
the pigskin some thirty yards from the Brown’s
goal-line. For the first time in many long, wet
minutes the spectators had something to thrill
over. A long-limbed, shock-headed Chancellor
forward in mud-reeking pants and torn jersey,
wearied and winded, went plunging and stumbling
and slipping toward a touchdown with the
field strewed out behind him. Interference was
hasty but effective. Parkinson and Chancellor
youths went down like nine-pins, splashing into
puddles, gouging into mud. For a moment it
seemed that the incident would end with twenty-two
players flat on the wet ground and only the
officials erect! But, although many fell by the
way, others managed to keep their feet and run
it out, and among these was the youth with the
ball. Twice he went to his knees, but each time
he recovered before the enemy reached him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
in the end he slid over the line close to the left
goal-post, and Chancellor shouted and leaped
with delight.</p>

<p>After the goal was prettily kicked the teams
went at it again, but to all purposes the game was
over and the score didn’t change again. Twenty-nine
to seven were the figures that, later in the
day, brought uneasiness to the Kenwood camp.
Yet, returning to Warne, it was noticed that Coach
Driscoll’s countenance did not reflect the satisfaction
shown on other faces. After supper that
evening he told Jud Mellen why. “You chaps
played a rattling game today,” he said almost
regretfully. “I haven’t a criticism to make that’s
worth the breath it would cost. Even the second
and third subs were good, almost without exception.
But I sort of wish you hadn’t done so well,
and that’s the truth.”</p>

<p>“Afraid of a slump,” said Jud, nodding
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly that. When a team reaches
its best two weeks before the big game it doesn’t
take a slump to queer it. It only needs a return
to ordinary playing, if you see what I mean. All
you fellows need do to get beaten two weeks from
today is to play the sort of football you played
last week against Day and Robins. There’s just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
that much difference between fine football and
good football, Cap. If it had been Kenwood
today instead of Chancellor, we’d have the championship
tucked away in our belt this evening. I
guess I’ve made a mistake somewhere: let you
fellows come too fast the last week or so. But I
didn’t have any warning that you were on the
last lap. It hasn’t shown once. Well, it’s up to
us now to stay where we are, Cap.”</p>

<p>“Or go ahead,” said Jud.</p>

<p>But Mr. Driscoll shook his head. “I’d like to
think so, but I’m afraid we reached top-notch
today. I’m always scared for a team that hasn’t
had a slump some time during the season. And
we haven’t. Not a real, sure-enough slump.
There was a tendency after the Phillipsburg
game, but it didn’t really amount to anything.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t feel like slumping,” laughed
Jud. “And I haven’t noticed any signs of it in
the others. Every one’s as cocky as you please
tonight, and barring a few bruises&mdash;and Flay’s
knee&mdash;they’re all in fine shape.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we came out of it mighty well,” agreed
the coach. “I hate a wet field, Cap. I hope to
goodness this rain doesn’t keep on for two or
three days. Rainy weather can play hob with a
team that’s the least bit over-trained.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re a regular pessimist tonight, Coach,”
Jud laughed. “Cheer up! By the way, Dobbins
told me this evening that Foster’s expecting to
get off pro. Kearns wasn’t half bad today, but
it would certainly make me feel easier in what I
call my mind to have Foster ready to take his
place.”</p>

<p>“Yes. See if you can get him out Monday.
There isn’t a whole lot of time left. Still, he’s
learned the position fairly well and might give a
good account of himself as he is. With another
ten days of training he ought to make a good
second for Kearns.”</p>

<p>The rain continued during Sunday and Myron
was restless and inclined to be as much of a pessimist
as the head coach. He was difficult to live
with, too, and Joe dragged him over to Mill Street
after dinner in the hope that Andrew would be
good for his soul. Andrew did, in truth, perk
him up not a little, predicting that he would get
his release from Doctor Lane the next day.</p>

<p>“I dare say he’s forgotten all about me,” said
Myron dismally. “Suppose Addicks doesn’t tell
him I’ve made good?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s up to Addicks, and that’s a fact,”
responded Andrew. “If nothing happens by
noon, I’d advise you to go to him and tell him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
the facts. Tell him you want to get back on the
team and can’t until he speaks a good word for
you to Jud. Addicks is a good sport and will do
it. I think he will, anyhow, though. You see if
you don’t hear from Jud in the morning.”</p>

<p>So Myron decided to hope for the best and
forgot his worries watching the amusing antics of
the puppies, by now sturdy little rascals who made
their mother’s life a burden and a boredom.</p>

<p>Andrew’s prediction came true, for the next
morning Myron was again summoned to the Office
and conducted into the presence of Doctor Lane.</p>

<p>“Mr. Addicks tells me that you’re doing very
much better, Foster,” announced the Doctor.
“In fact, he recommends that we lift the restrictions
in your case. Do you think that you will be
able to stay in good standing now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’m going to try hard, anyway,”
said Myron earnestly.</p>

<p>Doctor Lane smiled. “In that case I believe
that you will succeed, my boy. It’s wonderful
what really trying will accomplish. Very well,
Foster. You have permission to go back and
grind your face in the sod again. Like football
do you?”</p>

<p>“Very much, sir.”</p>

<p>“So do I. I used to play it once, a good many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
years ago. Do you consider that we have a good
chance to beat Kenwood this fall?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I think we will. We’ve got a bully
team!”</p>

<p>“So I understand. Well, we’ll hope so. Good
morning, Foster.”</p>

<p>Once outside the door of the outer office, Myron
broke into song. As a musical effort it was not
remarkably successful, but as an expression of his
feelings it met all requirements. Turning into
the entrance corridor, he almost ran into Paul
Eldredge. He and Paul had never spoken since
the encounter on the walk that evening. Paul’s
attitude toward him had been one of armed neutrality
expressed in sullen silence and sarcastic
glances. Now, acting on impulse, Myron stopped
and spoke.</p>

<p>“Say, Eldredge,” he blurted, “let’s call it off!
What do you say? I’m sorry for whatever it was
that&mdash;that offended you.”</p>

<p>Eldredge, surprised, at a loss, stared at Myron’s
smiling countenance for an instant, trying to think
of something sarcastic. Failing, he grunted, and
then, as Myron kept silence and waited, he said:
“All right,” none too graciously; adding: “I’m
satisfied if you are. You started it, anyway.”</p>

<p>Myron couldn’t remember whether he had or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
hadn’t just then, so he yielded the point. “Did
I? I’m sorry then. Let’s forget it, eh?”</p>

<p>Eldredge nodded more amiably. “Sure! I’m
willing.”</p>

<p>Then Myron nodded, laughed for no reason
that the other could fathom, and hurried on. The
laugh had nothing to do with Eldredge or with
the making of peace, but was just an advertisement
of the fact that life looked very good to him
at the moment.</p>

<p>Mr. Addicks, a half-hour later, positively
beamed on him, to the quiet amusement of those
of the class who knew of Myron’s recent status,
and Myron decided that the Latin instructor was
“a corking old chap.” Reinstatement amongst
the first team substitutes proved a most casual
affair that afternoon. He reported to Farnsworth
and the manager said, rather decently, “Glad
you’re back, Foster. All right, get into it.
That’s your squad down the field.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>EDDIE APPLIES THE BRAKE</small></h2>


<p>I think the experiences of the past week had
cleared the air in Myron’s case. Perhaps
Andrew’s curtain lecture at the hotel that Sunday
morning had its effect. Perhaps, too, the knowledge
that Joe and Andy had cared enough to go
to all that scheming and effort to bring him back
and save him from his own folly bucked him up.
At all events, he went to work hammer-and-tongs
and by Wednesday night had Steve Kearns looking
worried. Chas, viewing events interestedly,
chuckled to himself. Things were working his
way. Not only was he secretly aiding and abetting
the career of Myron, but there were three
others among the first and second choice fellows
who were under his care and who, willingly or unwillingly,
followed his instructions. Had Chas
cared to he could have taken a pencil and paper
and written down the line-up for next season’s
first important contest. Needless to say, against
the position of left guard would have been the
name of Cummins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>Chas was not without his qualms of uneasiness,
though, for Brodhead was now pushing him hard
for his place. Attending to the duties of next
year’s captain in anticipation somewhat detracted
from his playing qualities, and when, on Thursday,
he found himself left on the bench while
Brodhead was sent into the game against the
second at left guard, he realised dismayedly that
he would have to let next season look after itself
for the present and reinstate himself in the
coach’s good graces. Chas’ plans revolved on
his election to the captaincy, and it wasn’t usual
to elect to that position a fellow who had not
played in the big game. Chas studied his scarred
knuckles thoughtfully and wondered to just what
extent Mr. Driscoll would let his personal feelings
rule when it came to a choice between him and
Brodhead for the Kenwood game. Chas knew
perfectly well that the coach, without disliking
him, held it in for him on one or two scores, and
one must allow for a certain amount of human
nature, he reflected, in even a football coach!
Mentally he shook his head and acknowledged
that he would have to mend his ways. He wasn’t
certain, for that matter, that it was not already
too late, that, to use his own expression, he had
not already “spilled the beans”!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>That Thursday Myron got himself talked about.
He went in at full-back in the second half, vice
Kearns, and showed himself a remarkably proficient
player at that position. Coach Driscoll
watched him in genuine surprise, although, as
usual, he hid his feelings. “He’s just about four
times as good as he was before he was laid off,”
he said to himself, “and at least twice as good as
I ever thought he would be. Why, the chap’s a
born full-back! Give him a few more pounds for
line-bucking and he will size up with any of them.
Next year he ought to be All-American material,
by Jupiter! But I mustn’t spoil him. He’s too
good. And if he gets to knowing how good he is,
he’s likely to get fond of himself and fizzle out.
I think he’s the sort to do that. No, I guess we’ll
keep your spurs trimmed down pretty close,
Foster, my lad!” And in furtherance of that
plan the coach strode across to the first team
backfield and metaphorically ripped Myron up the
back, to the bewilderment of Myron and the puzzlement
of Jud and Joe and Katie and some
others! Myron ended the game in a chastened
mood, conscious of having made two touchdowns,
one by a wide run behind good interference and
one by downright grit from the four yards when
the advance had seemed at an end, but equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
conscious that he had not done as well as he should
have. He had Coach Driscoll’s word for the
latter, although the coach had somehow failed to
specify very exactly wherein Myron had failed.
There had been talk about “getting low” and
“using your legs,” but Myron didn’t really see
how he could have struck the line much lower
without going into it on his head or how he could
have got another ounce of push out of those
wearied legs of his. In the end, having been
refreshed with food and having listened to hearty
praise from his friends, he decided that coaches
were strange persons not always to be taken seriously.
But he didn’t get a swelled head over the
day’s performance, which was what the coach had
guarded against.</p>

<p>There was no practice on Friday for the first
team players, and so when Myron found a note in
the mail that morning signed Maurice Millard
saying that the writer would be in Warne that
noon and asking Myron to meet him at the hotel
at two o’clock, the latter was able to promise
himself an enjoyable afternoon. Unfortunately,
he had a recitation at two, but he left a note for
Millard at the hotel in the forenoon postponing
the meeting until a quarter to three. He recalled
Millard very pleasantly and was glad he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
to meet him again. He liked that name, too,
Maurice Millard: it had a swing to it, he thought,
even if it did sound rather like the name of a
moving-picture artist! He wished that Millard
had chosen to look him up at his room, for he
would have liked to introduce him to Joe. Joe
had seemed somehow rather sceptical as to
Millard’s charms. But he could bring the visitor
to Sohmer later on, for of course he would want
to see the school and visit the football field and
so on.</p>

<p>But, rather strangely&mdash;or so Myron thought,&mdash;Millard
declared in favour of taking a drive into
the country. “We can look around the school
when we get back,” he explained. “It’s a wonderful
day for a drive and I’m much fonder of the
country than I am of towns. And we can have
a jolly chat, too, and you won’t have to interrupt
yourself every ten seconds to say ‘That’s Smith
Hall, built in 1876 and used by General Washington
as headquarters during the football game
between Parkinson and Kenwood,’ or some other
such dope.”</p>

<p>As to its being a wonderful day for driving,
Myron had his doubts, for summer had returned
and the weather was decidedly hot in spite of the
fact that November was two weeks old. Still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
driving might be pleasanter than walking, and
the guest had the right to choose his entertainment,
and Myron capitulated. To find a conveyance,
however, was not so easy, for no Jehus slept
along the curb in front of the little hotel when
they went in search of one. Myron suggested
walking to the station, only a block or so distant,
and Millard consented. The difficulty was solved
before they got that far, however, for a new,
highly varnished taxi-cab darted toward them
from a side street and a dimly remembered youth
on the driver’s seat hailed Myron by name. He
proved to be the fellow who had conveyed Myron
to Sohmer that first day of school, and by the
time the latter had ended negotiations for the
hiring of the cab by the hour he remembered that
the sandy-haired young man was named Eddie
Moses. The cab appeared to be brand-new and
was certainly a vast improvement over the former
one. They went briskly out of the town toward
Sturgis, and, with all windows open, the drive
promised to be as enjoyable as Millard had predicted.</p>

<p>The visitor was as smartly, if quietly, dressed
as when Myron had seen him last, and Myron was
secretly glad that he had gone to extra pains in
the matter of his own attire. Myron asked about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
business and Millard reported everything fine, and
said that he had managed to get a small order
from the local dealer in athletic supplies that
morning. “Not much, you know, but enough to
let us show him that we have the goods he wants
and can sell to him cheaper than that New York
house. It’s a wedge, Foster.”</p>

<p>In spite of Millard’s expressed love of the
country, he didn’t seem to pay much attention to
its beauties. Before they had gone a mile he had
switched the conversation from athletic goods to
football, of which he appeared to know a great
deal. Myron wondered if he had played when at
school, and what that school had been, but somehow
he never got around to asking. He was glad
enough to talk about football, and he managed
before long to let Millard know that he was now
a member of the Parkinson first team. Millard
was clearly delighted with his friend’s good fortune,
and congratulated him warmly.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet anything you’ll make good, too, Foster,
when you fellows meet Kenwood. I hear they’ve
got only a fair team over there this year. I was
talking to a fellow from there only a couple of
days ago. ‘We aren’t telling it around, Art’&mdash;my
name’s Maurice Arthur, you know, and some
fellows call me Art,” he explained parenthetically.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
“‘We aren’t telling it around, but between you
and me we’ve got a pretty punk outfit this year.
We’re trying to keep Parkinson guessing, but if
they play the sort of game they played against
Chancellor they’ll have us on the run from the
beginning.’ Maybe I oughtn’t to tell this to a
Parkinson fellow, but he didn’t tell me not to, and
you and I are friends, so I guess there’s no harm.
Besides, I’d like mighty well to see you fellows
lick that Kenwood bunch. They’re too stuck-up
for me.”</p>

<p>“I won’t say anything about it to any one,”
said Myron virtuously. “Probably your friend
wouldn’t want it to get to our team.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind what he wants. If telling
your fellows’ll do them any good, you go ahead
and tell them. I’ll stand for it. How is the
team getting along, by the way? That was certainly
a peach of a licking you gave Chancellor.
I was reading about it in the paper last Sunday.”</p>

<p>Myron replied that the team was getting on
famously, and went into rather intimate details
to prove it. Millard was flatteringly interested
and encouraged Myron to talk, which Myron was
nothing loath to do since he was on a subject that
appealed to him vastly. Millard had many questions
to ask, questions which showed conclusively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
that he had a close understanding of football and
a wide acquaintance among players. With such
a listener Myron found it easy to pursue his subject.
Millard introduced debate by throwing
doubt on the ability of the Parkinson ends. He
said he thought Cousins and Leeds, the Kenwood
ends, would have the better of the argument, and
was only convinced to the contrary after Myron
had very thoroughly explained Stearns’ and
Norris’ methods, both on offence and defence.
There was simply no end to Millard’s interest in
football, and once&mdash;they were running through
the town of Sturgis at the moment&mdash;when Myron
feared that he was boring the other, in spite of
apparent willingness to listen, and sought to
change the subject, it was Millard who soon
brought it back again.</p>

<p>How the matter of signals came up, Myron
didn’t afterward recall, but it did, and it was
exhaustively dealt with. Millard spoke of a case
he knew of where the intricacy of the signals had
lost an important game for a certain high school
team. “I always think that the more simple the
signal system is the better it is. You take the big
colleges, now, Foster. They don’t ball the men
all up with double numberings and ‘repeats’ and
all those silly tricks. They select a simple system,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
one that’s easy to learn and remember.
Why, I’ve seen quarter-backs stutter and fumble
around for whole minutes trying to get their
signals straightened out. And as for the number
of times that backs have spoiled a play because
they didn’t get the signals right&mdash;&mdash;” Millard
whistled eloquently.</p>

<p>“Guess we won’t have any trouble that way,”
answered Myron complacently. “Our system’s
as simple as simple.”</p>

<p>“That so? Holes and players numbered from
left to right, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, we begin at the ends.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s a better scheme. Left end is 1,
left tackle, 3, and so on, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“No, we don’t number the players that way.
The openings&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The taxi-cab stopped so suddenly that Myron
bit his tongue over the last word as he pitched
forward. Of course Millard described much the
same gymnastic feat, but it is doubtful if Millard
heard, or thought he heard, what Myron did in
the brief instant that his head protruded through
a front window, for Eddie Moses’ neck stayed
Myron’s forward flight and Eddie’s mouth was
but a few inches from Myron’s ear. And in the
part of a second that it remained there it got the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
impression that some one, presumably Eddie, had
distinctly said: “<em>Shut up!</em>” That impression
did not register on his brain, however, until he
was back in his seat and Eddie had released his
emergency brake. Then, while Eddie, in reply
to Millard’s somewhat incensed question, was
apologetically explaining something about a dog
that had run almost under the wheels, he stared
startledly at the back of Eddie’s head. That told
him nothing, though, and he harked back to the
interrupted conversation to discover what could
have brought such a fiercely voiced admonition
from the driver, if, indeed, that admonition had
not been imagined. The shaking-up, however,
had jostled memory as well as body, and it was
Millard who supplied the information he sought.</p>

<p>“I didn’t see any dog,” he said huffily to Eddie.
“Guess you imagined it. Now, then, Foster, you
were explaining about that numbering.”</p>

<p>“What numbering?” asked Myron blankly.</p>

<p>“Forgotten?” laughed Millard. “Why, we
were talking about signals, don’t you remember?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” answered Myron thoughtfully. “So
we were. How would it do to take the Princeville
Road back, Eddie? That’ll give us more of a
drive.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it would do nothing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
sort, and Myron knew it, and Eddie Moses knew
it when he added cheerfully, “All right, boss!”
Only Millard didn’t know it, although it is likely
that he suspected it later when, in far less time
than it had taken them to reach Sturgis, they were
back again in Warne. During that journey back,
made at a greater speed than the trip away, Millard
tried vainly to swing the conversation back
to the topic of football, and football signals in
particular, but Myron seemed to have suddenly
wearied of the subject and wouldn’t stay put a
minute. He pointed out features of the landscape
for Millard’s admiring observation and invented
quite a few interesting legends about passing
houses or farms. After a while Millard managed
to display some enthusiasm for nature and for the
legends and was quite the entertaining and charming
youth he had been before that shaking-up.
But Myron thought that there had been a quarter
of an hour subsequent to it when the visitor had
sounded out of patience and even a trifle short-tempered.
He might have simply imagined it,
though. They were back in town long before
five, and Millard’s train didn’t leave until after
six, and there was plenty of time to visit the
school, but Millard recalled a forgotten appointment
at the hotel and was set down there accordingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
He was most apologetic and thanked
Myron for a good time and begged to be allowed
to go halves on the cab bill. This privilege Myron
indignantly denied. Millard promised to look
Myron up again shortly.</p>

<p>“I want to see the school and all that, you know,
Foster,” he declared. “Wish I could run up
there now, but I’ll be tied up until train time.
The next time I come you must come down and
have dinner with me.”</p>

<p>They shook hands and parted, Myron returning
to the cab and bidding Eddie drive him to
Sohmer. But out of sight of the hotel Myron
leaned over and addressed the back of Eddie’s
freckled neck. “Did you say anything to me the
time I went through the window?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yeah, I said ‘Shut up!’ You was doing a lot
of fancy talking to that guy, seemed to me.
’Course, he might be a friend of yours and all,
but you was telling him things about the football
team that you hadn’t ought to, see? That’s why
I jammed on the ’mergency. There wasn’t no
dog at all!”</p>

<p>“Oh,” murmured Myron, “I see. Maybe you’re
right. Anyway, I’m much obliged. Of course,
Millard is perfectly square, but he might talk.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, he might,” agreed Eddie. “Or he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
might let some one else do the talking. Here you
are, sir! Sohmer Hall, home of the rude rich!
Thank you, sir.” Eddie winked knowingly.
“I’m not talking any. Don’t you worry about me,
sir. So long!”</p>

<p>Myron made his way up the steps of the dormitory,
under the envious regard of three third class
youths, and climbed the stairs somewhat thoughtfully.
Certainly, Maurice Millard was all right,
but he was awfully glad that Eddie had imagined
that dog. Millard had repeated what the Kenwood
chap had told him about the Kenwood team,
information plainly not intended for publicity,
which showed that he was not exactly close-mouthed.
On the whole, decided Myron, he had
come horribly near to making an utter fool of
himself. He decided to say nothing about it to
Joe. Joe must already have a good enough opinion
of his common sense!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>FALSE COLOURS</small></h2>


<p>The preliminary season came to an end the next
day with the St. Luke’s Academy game. Football
affairs had become fairly hectic now and the
school marched to the field behind a strident brass
band, cheering and singing. Mass-meetings had
been held twice weekly ever since the Warne High
School contest, and songs had been practised and
cheers rehearsed, and today Parkinson was in
fine voice and filled with enthusiasm. St. Luke’s
was not a formidable opponent, and for that reason
had been chosen to fill in the last date before
the Kenwood game. A wise coach selects the
semi-final adversary with care and deliberation,
and a wrong selection may work much harm to
his charges. St. Luke’s was warranted by past
experience to give Parkinson a good battle without
requiring any extraordinary exertions on the
latter’s part. Usually the score was one or two
touchdowns to none, although not so long ago the
generally docile St. Luke’s had kicked over the
traces in the annual event and thrown a healthy
scare into Parkinson. On that historic occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the final score had been 17 to 10 in the home team’s
favour.</p>

<p>The Brown line-up was exactly as at the start
of the Chancellor game, with a single exception.
The name of Foster appeared as full-back instead
of Kearns. Whether he had been put in to save
Kearns for the Kenwood game or whether he was
there on his merits, Myron couldn’t decide. But
he played a good game while he remained in the
line-up. The cheering was fine and put heart into
them all, and Myron felt that afternoon as though
he could “lick his weight in wild-cats,” as Joe
might have put it. He wasn’t called on for many
punts, which was perhaps fortunate, for his punting
still lacked control. If he got distance he was
likely to send the pigskin to the wrong place,
while if he obtained direction he was liable to kick
short. But in the other departments he showed
up strongly. He was a big addition to the backfield
on defence, using his weight very knowingly,
and more than one St. Luke’s gain was nipped in
the bud by him. Speed aided him at line plunges,
and his runs, of which he got off three during the
time he played, together netted nineteen yards
against clever ends. Altogether, he was a success,
and coach and school recognised the fact, and
when, five minutes after the beginning of the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
half, he got rather the worst of a mix-up with
the St. Luke’s left half and was taken out in favour
of Kearns, he got a hearty cheer as he walked
none too steadily to the bench.</p>

<p>Myron was not the only player who deserved
praise that afternoon, for every fellow on the
team was good. If the perfection exhibited in the
Chancellor game was not quite duplicated it was
possibly because the incentive was lacking. St.
Luke’s was outweighed by several pounds and
was slower than she should have been. And
she seemed, too, to lack plays adapted to her style
of football. Parkinson failed to score in the first
quarter, ran up eleven points in the second, seven
more in the third and, in the last period, with a
line consisting almost entirely of substitutes, and
with second-string backs behind it, added a field
goal by way of good measure. Every one, even
Coach Driscoll, appeared perfectly satisfied with
the afternoon’s performance, and Parkinson’s
stock soared high that evening. It looked very
much as if the season was to glide smoothly and
uneventfully to a satisfactory close. But a week
still intervened, and in a week much may
happen.</p>

<p>On Monday, Norris, right end, started the programme
of events by breaking a bone in his right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
ankle. He did it by falling over a pail on the
stairs in Williams Hall. It wasn’t a serious disaster,
but it might easily impair his playing ability
five days later. Tuesday, Grafton, first-choice
substitute for Captain Mellen, came down with
laryngitis, and Snow, who was due to take Cantrell’s
place at centre in the event of that player’s
retirement, was called home to Illinois because of
serious illness in the family. Coach Driscoll
smiled grimly and wondered what further misfortunes
could happen in the remaining three
days. Coach Driscoll, it may be said, was never
designed for the peaceful life. He was more
contented when he was facing difficulties. Jud
Mellen, himself worried by the ill-luck, remarked
almost resentfully Tuesday evening: “Gee, Coach,
any one would think you’d got news that the whole
Kenwood team was down with the sleeping sickness,
you look so bright and merry. I’m sick!”</p>

<p>“No use pulling a long face, Cap,” replied Mr.
Driscoll. “After all, we’ve come through the season
remarkably. Something was bound to go
wrong, and I felt it. I guess I’m rather relieved
to find out what it is. And it might have been
worse.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we might have lost the whole team,”
responded Jud sarcastically. “Oh, I suppose we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
can pull through if nothing worse happens, but
I’m expecting Katie to fall off a roof or
Brown to get kicked by a mule tomorrow. This
has got me going for fair!”</p>

<p>“You look after Number One,” advised the
coach. “The best way to kill a trouble is to laugh
it to death!”</p>

<p>Jud expressed incredulous surprise when
Wednesday passed without further misfortunes.
There was a monster meeting that night and a
march through town and a speech by the Principal
from the porch of his residence and much enthusiasm
and noise. Myron did not take part in the
observances, for the players were now required to
remain in their rooms evenings as far as possible
and to be in bed promptly at ten o’clock. So far,
Myron had felt no nervousness, nothing approaching
stage-fright, but when Thursday arrived and
the field was well surrounded with cheering
youths and townsfolk and the band that was to
play on Saturday was adding to the din and there
was only light signal work, followed by punting
and catching for the backs, instead of the relief
of a good, hard scrimmage, why, then he felt a
trifle fluttery about the heart. It meant so much
to all those eager-eyed, laughing but secretly
earnest boys about him, that hoped-for victory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
and he was chosen to aid in the securing of it!
The realisation of responsibility sobered him and
then left him a trifle panic-stricken. Suppose he
failed them, the coach and Captain Mellen and
the school! For the moment it seemed that in such
an event he would not have the courage to stay on
and face them all. He almost wished that Coach
Driscoll would let Kearns play instead! But that
wish didn’t last long, and the panic was short-lived,
too. There was still a vague uneasiness disturbing
him, however, and that uneasiness was
due to remain with him during his waking hours
until the whistle blew on Saturday.</p>

<p>The second team, its usefulness at an end,
cheered and was cheered and performed a dignified
ceremony behind the east goal, to which, since
the first team players had trotted back to the gymnasium,
the audience flocked. Gravely, reverently,
torn jerseys, worn-out pants, shoes beyond aid
and various other disreputable articles of football
attire and use were piled on the jumping pit.
Then a football rules book was laid on top of all,
a gallon of kerosene applied and around the blazing
pyre the members of the second team slowly
circled with joined hands, chanting a strange
jumble of atrocious Latin and scarcely more acceptable
English. Gradually the pace grew faster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and the pæan brisker until, presently, the scene
was a ludicrous whirl of bodies amidst a wild
shriek of song and a cloud of smoke. In such
manner the second team disbanded, at the end,
spent with laughter and breathless from their
exertions, giving three feeble groans for Kenwood
and “nine long Parkinsons”!</p>

<p>Friday was a long and gloomy day. There was
little use trying to do anything at recitations if
you were on the team, and not much more if you
weren’t. You just bluffed, if you could, or threw
yourself on the mercy of the instructors, trusting
that they would prove human enough to be lenient.
They usually were, for long experience had proved
to the Parkinson faculty that for a week before
the big game and for several days after it normal
members of the student body were incapable of
interest in studies. To make matters more dismal
on Friday, it rained. It didn’t rain in a cheerful,
whole-souled way, but drizzled and stopped and
sulked and drizzled again, and you wanted to be
outdoors if you were in and wanted to be back
again as soon as you were out. There was blackboard
work for the players in the afternoon and
signal drill in the evening. Afterwards Myron
and Joe and Andrew chatted in Number 17 until
bedtime, while from over in front of Parkinson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
Hall the cheers of some five hundred youths arose
to the cloudy sky. Then came ten o’clock, and
Andy went, and the room-mates got thoughtfully
out of their clothes and crept beneath the covers,
each a trifle more silent than usual. To Myron’s
surprise, sleep came after a very short time, and
when he awoke the sun was bright in a crisp
November world and there were roystering sounds
from the bath-rooms down the corridor.</p>

<p>The first Kenwood invaders appeared well
before noon, and every hour after that brought
more until by two o’clock the streets of the town,
already fairly impartially arrayed as to shop windows
with the blue and the brown, wore a decidedly
cerulean hue. For the team, dinner was
served at twelve instead of one, and after that
there remained a long hour and a half before
they could find relief from inaction. They were
at liberty to do as they liked within reasonable
limits, and Myron and Joe and Chas wandered
across the campus and down School Street in
search of diversion. Chas was, in his own language,
“too old a bird to have nerves,” and he
didn’t intend that either of the others should
either. He was bubbling over with good spirits
and kept Myron and Joe laughing from the time
the three of them left the campus. Perhaps his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
cheerfulness was largely due to the fact that, at
the eleventh hour, Coach Driscoll had chosen him
over Brodhead for left guard. And perhaps the
coach had never intended to do anything else.
Chas never knew as to that. But he did know
that had things turned out differently for him his
plans for next season would have been of as much
interest as a last year’s bird’s nest!</p>

<p>Their progress through the unusually thronged
streets was frequently interrupted while Chas
greeted an acquaintance, generally one of the
enemy. In front of the hotel quite a crowd had
collected to peer through doors and windows at
the Kenwood heroes, who, having eaten dinner,
were herded in the lobby about coach and trainer
and rubbers. The three pushed into the throng
until they could glimpse their adversaries, and
Chas pointed out several of the notables to the
others: Leeds, captain and right tackle; the much-respected
McAfee, left half-back; Odell, full-back
and goal kicker extraordinary; Garrity, the
Blue’s clever quarter. “And the others I don’t
know the names of,” said Chas, “although that
whaling big, pop-eyed monster must be Todd,
their centre. He’s a new one this year. Wonder
which of the bunch is Lampley, the chap I’m up
against.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>“And I wonder which is my man,” said Joe.
“I hope he’s like his name!”</p>

<p>“Frost, isn’t it?” asked Chas. “They say he’s
good, but you’ll know more about him along
toward four-thirty.”</p>

<p>“Who are the fellows over there by the desk?”
asked Myron.</p>

<p>“The tall one’s their coach, and I guess the
others are the Board of Strategy, which is a fancy
name for a bunch of fellows who travel around
with the team and get their expenses paid out of
the travelling fund. I think the short fellow is
Whitely, their manager, but I’m not certain.
Come on, we’ll see enough of them before the
afternoon’s over!”</p>

<p>In the act of turning, Myron’s gaze encountered
a rather tall youth in the lobby whose face became
for the first time visible to him at that moment.
Surely it was Maurice Millard, he thought. And
yet it couldn’t be, since Millard would never be
hob-nobbing with the Kenwood coach. Resisting
Chas’ tug at his sleeve, he gazed at the object
of his speculations while a vague uneasiness took
possession of him. It was Millard! He knew him
now. It was Millard in a long fuzzy brown ulster
and a derby hat, Millard looking far less carefree
and cordial than he remembered him. Myron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
seized the departing Chas and literally dragged
him back through the crowd.</p>

<p>“Who’s the tall, good-looking fellow in the
brown coat?” he demanded anxiously.</p>

<p>“Where is he? I don’t see any good, tall-looking
fellow in&mdash;Oh, yes! That’s What’s-his-name,
the Kenwood third baseman. He’s a pill.
He’s played with them two years. Know him?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” answered Myron, “a&mdash;a little.
His name’s Millard, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Mill-ah? No, it isn’t Mill-ah; it’s Cooke,
Arthur Cooke. Come along home and stop annoying
the animals.”</p>

<p>Myron looked again, but there was no chance
for doubt. He turned and made his way through
the group of loiterers in the wake of Chas and
Joe. When he had overtaken the former he asked
earnestly: “Are you quite certain his name is
Cooke, Cummins?”</p>

<p>“Sure I am! Why not? He’s the blow-hard
that was going to do all sorts of things to Liddell
last spring, if you believe the papers. He is a
pretty fair batter, and that’s no joke, but Liddell
had him swinging like a gate and as mad as a hornet.
He got a scratch single, and that’s all he did
get, the big boob!”</p>

<p>“And&mdash;and he’s&mdash;he’s one of the Kenwood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
Board of Strategy, as you call it?” asked Myron
faintly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sort of. He scouts for them, I guess.
Anyway, I heard they caught him snooping around
the grounds of Chancellor last year and mighty
near tore his shirt off. Kenwood has a fine old
spy system, Foster, but it never gets her anywhere
except back home!”</p>

<p>Myron set the pace for the rest on the way
back, his thoughts appearing to affect his feet. It
was still only a little after a quarter past one and
they were not due at the gymnasium until two.
In that scant three-quarters of an hour, reflected
Myron sickeningly, he must find Coach Driscoll
and make his humiliating confession. Whether he
had given Millard, or Cooke, enough information
to affect the game, Myron didn’t know, but he did
know that the manly and honest thing to do was
to tell the coach all about it and let him decide
that question. That Mr. Driscoll would let him
play on the team after his confession had been
made was highly improbable, but there was no
help for that. In front of Parkinson Hall he made
some sort of confused excuse to the others and
hurried away.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>BEHIND THE STAND</small></h2>


<p>“You mean to tell me,” said Coach Driscoll
incredulously, “that you talked about the team
to a perfect stranger, Foster, to a fellow met on
a station platform?”</p>

<p>“Not so much the first time, sir,” answered
Myron miserably. “It was when he came here.
He didn’t seem like a stranger then, and I thought
he was what he said he was.”</p>

<p>“You did, eh? Why, he has prep school written
all over him! I simply can’t understand it,
Foster!” The coach looked helplessly to Jud
Mellen and from Jud to Farnsworth and Chas
and Katie. Myron had run Mr. Driscoll to earth
at last in the gymnasium, in consultation with the
trainer, and now they were in the little office of
Mr. Tasser, the physical director. The others
had been summoned from the locker room downstairs,
being the only players then in the building.
Having produced them, Billy Goode had discreetly
closed the door behind them and retired to the
entrance, where Myron could see him now through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
the glass partition, his purple and white sweater
radiant in the sunlight that flooded through the
doorway. Myron rather preferred looking at
Billy to meeting the accusing gaze of the coach.
He was not having a very happy time of it.</p>

<p>“Cooke’s crafty,” offered Katie. “I guess
he could easily make you believe he was a travelling
salesman if he wanted to try, and you didn’t
know him.”</p>

<p>Chas nodded, scowling, but the coach said impatiently:
“What of it? Even if Foster thought
he was that, he shouldn’t have talked. A travelling
man is the last person on earth to tell secrets
to! Didn’t it even occur to you, Foster, that the
fellow might repeat what you said?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, it didn’t. He seemed such a&mdash;a decent
sort, Mr. Driscoll!”</p>

<p>“Let’s get this right,” said Jud impatiently.
“Tell us again just what you told him, as near as
you can remember.”</p>

<p>Myron did so. His recollection of the two conversations
was none too clear, however, and he
faltered several times.</p>

<p>“And then he brought in the subject of signals?”
prompted the coach. “Can you remember
what you told him then?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I told him anything of&mdash;of consequence,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
answered Myron. “He said he thought
that simple signals were best and told a lot of
stories about games where the players had got the
signals wrong because they were too complicated.
And he told about some team a long while ago
where they used to use words instead of numbers.
I said our signals were simple enough, and he
said he supposed we numbered the openings and
the players from right to left; or maybe he said
left to right. And I told him we didn’t; that we
began at the ends and numbered in; and then
Eddie Moses stopped the cab quick and threw us
off the seat.”</p>

<p>“Eddie appears to deserve a medal and resolutions
of thanks,” observed the coach drily.
“You’re quite certain that was all you told him,
Foster? It was at the point you speak of that
the jolt came?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I think I had started to say something
else, but I didn’t have time.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of thoughtful silence.
Myron looked about the circle of troubled faces
and wished himself at the bottom of the ocean.
At last Chas spoke. “Well, say, folks, I don’t see
that there’s been much harm done. Foster didn’t
tell that fox anything Kenwood didn’t know already,
I guess, except about the signals. They’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
seen us play all fall and know just about as much
about our players and the way they play as we
do.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” murmured Farnsworth. “They
had three scouts at the Chancellor game.”</p>

<p>“What about the signals, though?” asked Mr.
Driscoll, frowning. “How much could Cooke
make of what Foster so kindly informed him?”</p>

<p>“Mighty little, I’d say,” answered Katie.
“There are just as many ways of numbering from
the ends to the middle as there are from one end
to the other, or from the middle out. Seems to me
this Eddie boy put the brakes on at about the right
minute!”</p>

<p>“Eddie ought to get a season ticket,” said Chas.</p>

<p>“Well, the fat’s in the fire and there’s no use
trying to pull it out now,” said the coach resignedly.
“If we find they’re on to our signals
we’ll have to switch. I guess we’d better arrange
a new code before the game, Cater.”</p>

<p>“That’s easy, Coach. Just change about and
number from the centre out.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t do, Cater. The fellows would get
balled up unless they had a good hour’s drill first.
We’ll have to think up some simpler method.”</p>

<p>“Double the odd numbers,” suggested Chas.
“Call 1, 11, 2, 22; and so on. They did that last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
year on the second and we couldn’t get it at all
till they told us after the season.”</p>

<p>“That might do,” agreed the coach, and the rest
nodded. “That would make outside left end
99,” he reflected. “Sound all right to you,
Cater?”</p>

<p>“Sure! That’s easy enough, but what about
11, 13 and 15? Call them 111, 113 and 115?”</p>

<p>“I think so. We’ll have to change the sequence
call, though. We’ll make it any even number over
100.”</p>

<p>“Your friend Cooke wouldn’t approve, though,
Foster,” said Farnsworth. “He’d say they were
too complicated.”</p>

<p>Myron flushed, but made no answer.</p>

<p>“Get the team together as soon as you can,
Cap,” said the coach, “and let Cater go over the
new signals with them a couple of times. Mind,
though, we don’t change unless it’s evident that
Kenwood is solving the plays. That’s all, you fellows.
Just a minute, Foster, please.”</p>

<p>The rest hurried out and down the stairs.
Myron leaned back again in the chair with a
sigh. Mr. Driscoll viewed him coldly.</p>

<p>“I suppose you realise that you’ve made rather
a mess of things,” said the coach. Myron assented
in silence. “The things you let out to this Kenwood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
spy may mean just the difference to us between
winning and losing. I hope they won’t, but
they may. I don’t believe in hitting a man when
he’s down, Foster, and so I won’t say any more
about it. I suppose you’re feeling rather rotten
yourself.” The boy’s glance was answer enough.
“I was going to have you start the game at full.”
He paused and Myron’s heart sank. “I’ve
changed my mind. There may be a chance for you
before the game’s over, but don’t count on it.
If you should by any possibility get in, Foster,
I shall expect you to try very hard to make up for
any mischief you’ve caused with that tongue of
yours. That’s all. You’d better hustle down and
go through those signals.”</p>

<p>When Myron had gone Mr. Driscoll frowned.
“I wonder,” he muttered, “if that was the right
thing. Sort of tough on him, too. And if he
should get sore&mdash;Well, we’ll see.” Lifting the
telephone beside him, he called the locker room.
“Hello! Who is this? Oh, Mistley? Well, ask
Farnsworth to come up here a minute, please.”</p>

<p>The manager appeared promptly and behind the
closed glass door the two spoke briefly with heads
close together. Then Farnsworth arose and sped
out, an expression of unholy glee on his countenance,
and the coach, tapping the ashes from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
pipe, dropped it into his pocket and went downstairs.</p>

<p>Across the campus a clock struck two.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The teams that faced each other that afternoon
were fairly matched in weight and, as events
proved, closely matched in skill. Neither the
Brown nor the Blue found herself until the first
fifteen-minute period was nearly over. Each
seemed to lack confidence, and those who hoped to
see one team or the other take the lead at the
start were doomed to disappointment. There was
much punting in that first quarter, some half-hearted
rushing that soon slowed down, several
fumbles and not a little bad judgment. Each team
appeared more intent on watching her opponent
than on playing the game, and it was not until the
very end that Parkinson awoke from her lethargy
and got into her stride.</p>

<p>A fortunate forward-pass started her up, and
from her own forty-two yards to the enemy’s
thirty-four she took the ball on line attacks varied
by one wide, swinging run by Meldrum. But the
Blue was also awake now and her line steadied and
Parkinson was forced to punt. Kenwood plunged
twice and returned the punt and Cater caught and
was downed in his tracks. Kearns made a scant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
yard at guard on the right of the line and time
was called.</p>

<p>Starting again from near Parkinson’s forty-yard
line, the ball went across the centre and back
again. Cater was nailed when he attempted a
quarter-back run to the left and Brown made four
yards in two tries. Keith fell back and punted out
of bounds at the twenty-five. No advantage accrued
to either team for the next five minutes.
Parkinson was set back for holding and Kenwood
was twice penalised for off-side. The spectators’
hearts went into their throats when a Kenwood
back misjudged a punt, and it looked for an instant
as if the Brown was to score. But Norris missed
the ball and the Kenwood quarter fell on it eight
yards from the goal-line. The Blue promptly
punted out of danger. Parkinson failed to gain at
the Blue line and made a forward which grounded.
She then punted to the enemy’s thirty yards. The
half ended with the pigskin in Parkinson territory
near the middle of the field and in Kenwood’s possession.</p>

<p>Neither team had shown ability to gain consistently
at her opponent’s line. Parkinson had
made two first downs and Kenwood one. At punting
Kenwood had outdistanced the Brown by some
five yards on each kick, but had not gained any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
advantage by it, since Stearns and Norris were
playing the game of their lives. In short, it was
still anybody’s game. During half-time the rivals
contended with cheers and songs, the contest going
to Parkinson by reason of a slight advantage in
numbers and the possession of a brass band. It
was about the middle of that fifteen-minute intermission
that a small youth in the attire of a
messenger boy came wandering along the edge of
the Kenwood stand. “Mr. Cooke!” he droned.
“Message for Mr. Cooke!”</p>

<p>In response a youth in a fuzzy brown overcoat
arose from the group on the nearly deserted
players’ bench. “All right, kid!” he called.
“Here I am! Let’s have it!”</p>

<p>“You Mr. Cooke?” asked the boy suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Yes, A. M. Cooke. Is it for me?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, that’s right: A. M. Cooke. Well, you’re
wanted at the telephone.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?” asked Cooke, vaulting the rope
into the passage. The boy waved a thumb over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Out there,” he said vaguely. “I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>Cooke followed, winding his way through the
crowd about the entrance. At the gate he spoke
to one of the ticket takers. “Let me have a check,
will you?” he asked. “I’m coming back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy presiding at the box smiled mysteriously.
“That’ll be all right,” he said. “You
won’t need any check.”</p>

<p>Afterwards, Cooke concluded that it was at
that moment that suspicion began to creep in.
But the messenger led on and he followed around
the back of the stand and into the presence of
four grim-looking and extremely athletic first
class fellows. Cooke saw no telephone, and a
frown gathered on his classic brow. The messenger
was speaking. “Here he is,” he said. “I
got him. Where’s me half?”</p>

<p>A coin changed hands. Cooke looked on curiously,
a question trembling on his lips. But he
didn’t need to ask that question. Suddenly the
four youths encompassed him closely and he felt
no further interest in telephones.</p>

<p>“Is your name Cooke?” asked the spokesman.</p>

<p>Cooke wanted very much to deny it, but knew
that denial would be futile. So he said yes, and
the other went on as follows:</p>

<p>“Well, Cooke, we don’t like your sort. There’s
a train that will take you to Kenwood leaving our
station in fifteen minutes. If I were you I’d try
mighty hard to get it. It won’t be healthy for you
around here after it’s gone.”</p>

<p>Cooke moistened his lips. “Why should I?” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
demanded in a weak attempt at bluster. “I paid
to see this game&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. You’ll get your money back.
We’ve bought your train ticket, and there’s
eighteen cents change coming to you. You can
walk to the station comfortably in twelve
minutes.” The speaker looked at his watch.
“You’ve just got twelve if you start now. These
chaps are going with you to show the way and see
that you don’t change your mind.”</p>

<p>Cooke looked at the faces surrounding him, bit
his lip, laughed weakly and shrugged. “I suppose
you think you’re frightfully clever,” he said,
“but you’re not worrying me any. I don’t care
to see the game, anyhow. We’ll beat you, so
what’s it matter?”</p>

<p>“Eleven minutes,” was the reply. “You’ll have
to run if you don’t start quick.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I don’t choose to go?” asked Cooke
defiantly.</p>

<p>“Why, that would be very unhealthy for you,”
answered the other, a smile threatening his
gravity. Cooke looked up at the stand. There
were plenty of friends there, but there seemed to
be no way of reaching them. At the top a few
occupants of the last row were looking down
curiously, but they appeared quite unsuspicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
of the indignity being visited on their schoolmate.
Cooke yielded.</p>

<p>“All right,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“And, one thing more, Cooke,” said the spokesman
of the little committee, “it will be better if
you don’t come over here with the baseball team
next spring. In fact, if I were you, I’d take good
care to stay away from here. We don’t like
spies.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />
<small>FULL-BACK FOSTER</small></h2>


<p>“That’s all, I guess,” said Coach Driscoll in conclusion.
“The main thing is to play hard, fellows,
and play fast. I don’t think we’ll have to
change our signals. If Kenwood was on to them
she’d have showed it before this. So tear in now
and show what you can really do. No more sleeping
on the job, no more watchful waiting. Here’s
your line-up. Stearns, Mellen, Cummins, Cantrell,
Dobbins, Keith, Mistley, Cater, Meldrum, Brown,
Foster. On the run now!”</p>

<p>Myron, startled, gazed incredulously at the
coach across the room. The others were heaving
toward the doors, and he jumped up and followed,
overtaking the coach in the corridor at the foot of
the short stairway.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;you said&mdash;me, Mr. Driscoll?” stammered
Myron.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the coach calmly. “You’re in,
Foster.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” He darted forward, stopped and sprang
back again. “Thank you, sir,” he said gratefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, my boy.” Mr. Driscoll smiled.
“You know what to do!”</p>

<p>Know what to do? Well, he rather thought he
did, he told himself as he trotted across the little
space of turf to the rope. His lips were very tight
together and it wasn’t until Joe smote him resoundingly
between the shoulders that he knew
he had been spoken to.</p>

<p>“Good stuff, kiddo!” Joe was repeating. “Glad
you’re back. Go to it and eat ’em up, Brother!”</p>

<p>The cheering was deafening. Across the
trampled field the Kenwood players were already
throwing aside their blankets. Near at hand the
Warne Silver Cornet Band was blaring loudly,
although all he got of it was the insistent <em>thump,
thump, thump!</em> of the big drum. Then they were
clustered on the side-line for a last earnest word
from Jud Mellen and a minute later, spread over
the east end of the gridiron, they awaited the
whistle.</p>

<p>Myron played through the first few minutes in
a queer sort of daze. He got his signals, fell into
place and went through the plays, but it was much
as though some one else was doing it and he was
only looking on. What brought him to, in a manner
of speaking, was a fine clout on his head when,
Kenwood having taken the ball on downs by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
few inches, the play piled through between Joe
and Paul Keith and Myron found himself a part
of the squirming heap two yards behind his line.
The blow from some one’s shoe cleared his brain
very effectively and the some one who played and
the some one who looked on became instantly
merged. Which, perhaps, was a lucky thing, since
a minute later, after Kenwood’s quarter had fumbled
and Mistley had squirmed through on top of
the ball, he was called on to punt.</p>

<p>For an instant his nerves jangled badly while
he awaited the ball with outstretched hands, but
when he had it between his gripping fingers he
forgot. A quick turn, a step forward, a swing of
his long leg and a fine, full thud of leather against
leather! Off sailed the ball, well over the up-flung
hands of the enemy, straight toward the corner of
the field. He side-stepped a charging Kenwood
forward, went down under the kick and found his
place again near the Blue’s twelve yards. Back
up the gridiron presently, Kenwood kicking on
the second down. Then a fake and a run to the
right by Meldrum for a scant yard, a short gain
past tackle on the left by Brown, and finally another
punt, not so long this time. And so it went,
neither side gaining her distance, both reverting to
punts in the end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>Time was taken out for Cantrell, again for
Katie, again for a Kenwood end, and the game was
slowing up. Two penalties were awarded, and the
opponents shared them. It was near the end of
the third quarter now. Brounker took Meldrum’s
place and Kenwood changed her left guard.
Myron was dirty and bruised and panting, but so
they all were. Chas had a long cut down one
cheek that made him look like a desperado, but
he was grinning broadly every minute. Jud Mellen
was everywhere, encouraging, pleading, scolding,
his voice sounding like the rasp of a file.</p>

<p>Brounker got clean away and was forced out at
his own forty-six yards after a twelve-yard gain.
The Brown flags waved and a great cheer crashed
across the field. Myron charged straight at the
centre, found a hole awaiting him and sped
through, Joe’s voice growling above the rasp of
canvas and the laboured breaths of tired lungs.
“<em>Atta boy, kiddo! Atta boy!</em>” Back came the ball:
Mistley had been off-side. Katie called Stearns
around and slammed the ball at him as he sped
past, but Kenwood had guessed the play and
Stearns made less than a yard. Then Myron had
the ball overhead and was watching Stearns running
back, far over on the left. A long heave
and a good one, but a Kenwood half spoiled it and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
it was fourth down. Myron punted. A whistle
blew.</p>

<p>The mouthful of water no more than dampened
Myron’s dry throat.</p>

<p>“Once I saw a whole pond full of this stuff,”
panted Chas as he took the dipper from Myron.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” begged the other. “There ain’t no
such thing!”</p>

<p>Jud dragged Chas aside and Joe joined Myron
as they walked over to where the umpire awaited
them above the ball. “How’s it going?” asked
Joe. “Some game, kiddo, believe me!”</p>

<p>“Can’t we score, Joe?” asked Myron, scowling.</p>

<p>“Sure we can! We’re going to! That centre
of their line’s just ready to cave, kiddo. It’s all-in
from tackle to tackle. The new guy they put in
for Lampley’s a cinch. Keep at ’em, Brother!
You’re going fine!”</p>

<p>And yet the last quarter was many minutes old
before Myron found any indication that Joe’s
prophecy was to come true. Then, very suddenly,
Brown romped through the Blue’s centre
and fought for eleven yards before he was brought
down. That was the first decisive gain through
the Kenwood line, and the Parkinson adherents
shouted frantically. But another attack at the
same place was stopped for less than two yards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
and a third netted nothing. A skin-tackle play,
Brounker carrying, gave the Brown five yards
more. Faking a punt, Myron sped to the left,
cut in and got the distance. Again came the
Parkinson cheers.</p>

<p>“We’ve got them going, Parkinson!” cried
Katie. “They can’t stop us now! Make this
good, fellows! Play hard!”</p>

<p>“Hard! Hard!” croaked Jud, smiting the
crouching men. “Into it! Get into it, Parkinson!”</p>

<p>But there was a long road to travel and time
was speeding, and although three times the Brown
made her distance by narrow margins, on the
twenty-three yards, with the Blue’s goal beckoning,
Kenwood rallied and held through three
downs. Then, while the shouting stands became
silent, Paul Keith fell back and judged the
distance to the cross-bar. Kenwood swayed and
gasped, her quarter shrilly calling on his men to
“<em>Block this kick! Block it! Block it!</em>” Back
sped the ball, was dropped&mdash;</p>

<p>A groan arose from the Brown stand. Far to
the right of the goal travelled the ball. The blue-stockinged
warriors danced and shouted in glee.
Keith’s head dropped despondently as he turned
back up the field. “Seven minutes to play,” called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
the field judge. Then they were battling
again.</p>

<p>Perhaps that lost score had its effect, for Kenwood
was soon in Parkinson territory. As far as
the thirty yards she went before she was stopped.
Her punt went over the line and the ball came out
to the twenty-five. Two attacks at the Kenwood
centre brought the distance. Kenwood had new
material in her line now. Brown tried an end and
got three. But he was hurt and Vance took his
place. Vance was stopped for a slight loss when
he tried left tackle. Myron gained four through
left guard and Brounker followed with three more.
The tape left the ball in Parkinson’s possession.
Another forward, Myron to Stearns, failed. The
ball was in mid-field now and there were but three
minutes left. The stands were already emptying
slowly. Coach Driscoll began sending in substitutes,
fellows who had worked hard and deserved
their letters. Joe was gone, Cummins, Cater, even
Keith, who alone might score a field-goal should
Fortune give the opportunity. Warren had taken
Cater’s place. Warren was fresh and eager and
undismayed. His signals came snappily, and he
pushed the wearied veterans hard.</p>

<p>“Make it go!” he chanted. “Make it go! Don’t
give up the ball! There’s time enough left to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
score. Here’s where we get away from them.
Come on, Parkinson! Show your grit!”</p>

<p>Brounker and Vance gained. The Kenwood line
was weakening fast now, but Myron feared that it
was too late. Vance again, past left tackle on a
criss-cross. Then Myron, sliding off left guard
for the needed distance. Well past the fifty-yard
line now, and still going, but with seconds remaining
instead of minutes and the time-keeper’s eyes
glued to the dial of his watch. If only they could
get past those Kenwood backs, thought Myron!
The Blue line was pasteboard now, but the backs
still fought hard and held firm. Somewhere near
the enemy’s thirty yards Warren called a sequence
and Myron’s heart leaped. If they played quickly,
smoothly, they <em>must</em> get through! Brounker tried
left of centre and piled through, but was nailed by
Kenwood’s backs. Four yards! Then, without
signals, the team snapped into the next play. A
quick shift to the right, Brounker sprang away to
the left, the ball sped back straight from centre
and Myron caught it. Kenwood sensed danger
now and shifted back to meet it, but Myron was
already charging past the left of the line, the interference
working like a charm. He was through
before he realised it and only a surprised quarter-back
stood between him and the goal!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>Ahead and at his right sped Vance, tuckered but
still game. Behind him weary feet pounded. In
his ears was a mighty noise that he knew for the
wild, imploring shrieks of friend and foe.
Through it came the dull <em>thump, thump!</em> of the
bass drum. Twenty yards more now, and the
quarter, white-faced and desperate, running
toward him with clutching fingers. Then Vance
was down, run out, and Myron was alone. Fifteen
yards and the Kenwood quarter-back poising for
his tackle! Myron gave a little toward the side-line,
slackened his pace and then, with a final demand
on his strength, sprang forward again at
renewed speed. The quarter-back leaped. Myron
felt his arms at his hips as he spun on his heel.
One arm fell away, but a hand closed inside his
leg above the knee and a great weight pulled at
him. One plunge, a second, and the last line was
swimming in his sight. Then, as if by a miracle,
the clutching hand was gone, and, freed of the
dragging burden, Myron stumbled, fell to his
knees, recovered and went on, <a href="#image04">straight across the
last white line to victory</a>!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 357px;">

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_325"><i>Straight across the last white line to victory</i></a></div>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Parkinson did not add a goal to her touchdown.
She did not even try, for the crowd that overspread
the field refused to be dispersed, and, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
the last second of play had ticked itself off just before
Myron had reached the line, no one insisted
very hard. Parkinson was satisfied with that lone
6; and if Kenwood was not, why, that was of small
moment! Blue banners waved, the band led, the
victors followed, caps floated across the goal bars,
the big drum said <em>Thump! Thump! Thump!</em> and
pandemonium reigned supreme over Parkinson
Field.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some four hours later, Andrew Merriman,
crossing the campus on his way to Sohmer, almost
collided with a small and visibly excited youth
who, panting an apology, added: “They’ve elected
the new captain! I got it from a waiter!”</p>

<p>“Have they, son? Well, who is he?”</p>

<p>“Bet you couldn’t guess! I’ve told three fellows
already and not one of them guessed right!”</p>

<p>“Then there’s no use in my trying,” replied
Andrew amiably. “Suppose you tell me.”</p>

<p>“It’s&mdash;<em>Cummins</em>!”</p>

<p>“<em>No!</em>”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is! What do you think of that? Why,
no one expected <em>he’d</em> get it!”</p>

<p>“No one,” chuckled Andrew as the youngster
disappeared into the gloom. “Anyway, no one
but Cummins!”</p>
